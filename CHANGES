Changes to Xfig
=============================================================================
Version 3.2
=============================================================================

Patchlevel 3a (Jan 19, 2000)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Library of UML objects (Unified Modelling Language)
	  From Andreas Ludwig (ludwig@ipd.info.uni-karlsruhe.de)

BUGS FIXED:
	o w_menuentry (subclassed menu entry widget) has been modified to be
	  compatible with the X11R5 Intrinsics besides R6
	o Several bugs in sprintf statements which create export command
	o Incorrect lengths reported when drawing box with "showlengths" on
	  and user scale != 1.0 (e.g. 1cm = 3km)
	o Declaration for preview_widget was both static and extern
	o Declaration for preview_pixmap was both static and extern
	o Two vars passed to XGetGeometry should have been int instead of
	  unsigned int (CreateCheckbutton() proc)
	o Added '#include "w_msgpanel.h"' for every file containing calls to
	  put_msg() or file_msg() since they contain varargs and should be
	  declared as having variable arguments

-----------------------
NOTE ABOUT GIF SUPPORT:

	Because Unisys has stated that they WILL charge royalties for the
	use of the LZW compression algorithm even in FREE programs, I have
	removed all traces of the GIF LZW compression/decompression code from
	xfig.  Xfig now calls giftopnm and ppmtopcx to import GIF files.
	Screen capture writes a PCX file.
	Exporting is handled by calling the ppmtogif program from fig2dev.

Patchlevel 3 (Jan 14, 2000)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Arrow thickness is a function of line width by default now instead of
	  absolute
	o If figure is modified and user does "File/New", xfig first asks if
	  user wants to save the file before doing the "new" operation
	o Changed the "paste text" key in app-defaults file from F20 to F12,
	  because most systems don't have an F20 key.  The "Paste" key on Sun
	  workstations (it is really F18) may also be used to paste text.
	o Changed default export border margin width to 0
	o Re-enabled export magnification for EPS
	o New "Flags" group of library objects from Rolan Rosenfeld.  These are
	  flags of Europe which Roland converted from a Sketch example.
	  There is also Japan's and the U.S.'s flag which were drawn in xfig by
	  Brian Smith
	o Added Ian MacPhedran's web site http://duke.usask.ca/~macphed/soft/fig/
	  for FIG-related information to the html docs under "Related Applications"
	  in the "Getting and Installing Xfig" section
	o Moved allocation of xfig's 32 "standard" colors last in the widget
	  setup procedure so that there is a better chance of the widgets
	  getting the correct colors before the colormap fills up and xfig 
	  changes to a private map.
	o Assumes default of Letter(or A4 if metric mode) if no %%BoundingBox in
	  imported eps
	o All traces of GIF decoding/encoding have removed from xfig so as to
	  avoid the patent royalty issue with Unisys corp.  xfig now calls
	  giftopnm (part of the netpbm package) to read the GIF file and then
	  ppmtopcx to convert it to a colormapped image that xfig's read_pcx
	  routine can handle.
	o Mr. T. Sato's email address has changed to VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp as
	  of July 15, 1998. He is the person to whom you should send email if
	  you have any questions about the Japanese HTML pages.
	o New depth manager.  Enable/disable depths individually or all at once
	  to selectively hide parts of drawing.  Can also click on one depth
	  button and drag mouse up or down to enable/disable multiple buttons.
	  Command-line options -showdepthmanager and -hidedepthmanager to
	  control it (resource Fig.showdepthmanager).  The default is to show it.
	o When updating the depth of a compound object, the relative depths of
	  the objects inside are retained, with the object having the smallest
	  depth number being assigned to the value updated by the user.  For
	  example, if you update a compound object to depth = 5, and it contains
	  objects with depths 8 and 11, after the update they will have depths
	  5 and 8 respectively. From T. Sato.
	o Default depth for creating new objects is now 50 to make it easier to
	  put new objects on top without having to remember to start the older
	  objects at a depth > 0.
	o Xfig allows panning to negative x and y now. This is the default
	  and may be turned and off with the -allow_neg command-line option
	  and from the global settings panel.
	o Command panel has pull-down menus for File, Edit, View and Help
	  operations.  Default accelerators for these menus are Meta-F, Meta-E,
	  Meta-V, and Meta-H respectively.
	  File menu includes list of recently loaded Fig files.
	o Comments in Fig files are preserved with the objects and are written
	  back when the file is saved.  Popup edit for objects allows entering/
	  editing of comments.  Also, clicking mouse button 2 on the canvas in
	  edit mode will popup a panel to edit comments for whole figure.
	o From the File/Open panel, you may startup another xfig process to open
	  a Fig file.  From T. Sato.
	o New join/split button to split a line/spline/etc into two, or to join
	  two lines/splines etc together to make one.  Also, will convert a box
	  to a line by splitting between two corners, and close an open line
	  or spline by joining the two ends.
	o Arrow keys, Home and End keys may be used to browse any of the lists
	  in xfig. (e.g. Open file list, library popup object list, misspelled
	  word list in spell checker)
	o Border option put back in for exporting to EPS and bitmap formats
	  (fig2dev -b option).
	  User may specify border margin in pixels (roughly).  This will be
	  a background margin area around the figure bounding area.
	o New background color option for printing and exporting - sets whole
	  background of figure to this color.  Available for all bitmap formats
	  and PostScript, EPS, PSTEX, and PDF
	o New background option to specify background color for figure.  This
	  works for all bitmap formats and PostScript (including pstex).
	  This is passed to fig2dev as the -g option.
	o If your system uses /etc/printcap to define printers, xfig will make
	  a pulldown menu for the printer selection in the printer panel.
	o New "smooth" button in export to smooth when exporting to bitmap
	  format (e.g. GIF, JPEG).  Causes fig2dev (using -S 2 option) to force
	  ghostscript to render at 2x magnification which improves font
	  rendering, then passes through pnmscale to reduce to original size,
	  which also smooths the image by averaging colors of adjacent pixels.
	o Export/Print errors now appear in the popup error message window
	o Popup object editor positions itself adjacent to object being edited
	  instead of possibly being on top of it
	o Xfig automatically chooses pwidth, pheight and the number of buttons
	  per row on the mode panel (left side) if necessary, to fit on a small
	  screen.  If the user explicitely chooses any of those options, their
	  choice overrides the automatic setting.
	  From T. Sato (VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp).
	o New PDF export driver (uses ps2pdf from the ghostscript distribution)
	o New CGM export driver (Computer Graphics Metafile) for fig2dev (and in
	  xfig export menu)
	  from Philippe Bekaert (Philippe.Bekaert@cs.kuleuven.ac.be)
	o More paper sizes (Japanese JIS B0-B10 and ISO A0-A9)
	o Middle button in paste mode will place object at its original position
	  (where it was when it was placed in the xfig cut file)
	o "Spinners" increment/decrement by value appropriate to item being
	  modified.  E.g., fill intensity % now steps by 5% for each click
	  of the mouse on the spinner arrows, and text step by 0.1.
	o Also, if mouse button is held down on spinup/down button, spinner
	  counts automatically after "spinner_delay" every "spinner_rate"
	  milliseconds (resources).
	o Fill intensity and Pattern fill now show image in popup edit panel
	o Can now draw arcs by defining:
		1. Center point
		2. First angle/Radius
		3. Second point to deterimine direction
		4. Final angle
	    Initiate this mode by starting arc with mouse button 2. Original
	    arc mode still available.  From T. Sato (VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp).
	o New color scheme (grayish instead of bisque) - can still use old
	  colors by using Fig-color.bisque.ad or really old colors in
	  Fig-color.classic.ad
	o I have made the web pages available from our server at:
	      http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig
	  A mirror site in Japan is
	      http://www.lint.ne.jp/~masashi/xfig/index.html
	o Popup window with global settings (use Meta-g or Alt-g) containing:
		o checkbutton for tracking mouse in rulers
		o checkbutton for showing page borders
		o checkbutton for showing info balloons
		o checkbutton for lengths on lines
		o checkbutton for showing vertex numbers on objects
		o entry for max image colors
		o entry for image editor
		o entry for spelling checker
		o entry for HTML browser
		o entry for PDF viewer
		o checkbutton for turning on/off debug information
	     Consequently, the balloon on/off checkbutton has been removed from
	     the message window area
	o Two new "make" options:
	   1. "make install.doc" - install only the documentation files (i.e.
	      man pages, html, and pdf files)
	   2. "make install.libs" - install only xfig object libraries
	o Filename mask for File and Export panels can have multiple wildcard
	  masks separated by blanks or tabs, e.g. "*.fig *.fig.gz *.fig.[Zz]"
	o Export wildcard mask is dynamically changed when selecting the export
	  language (e.g. *.gif when GIF is selected for export).  Thus, the
	  Fig*export_panel*mask*string resource is defunct.
	o New format for browser resource will parse for "%f" and replace with
	  the filename.  Using this and the -remote option for netscape, xfig
	  will either use a running netscape to open the help file (html) or
	  will start one if one isn't already running.
	o PDF viewer resource is also parsed for %f (filename)
	o Xfig will first try the correct PostScript font name (e.g. AvantGarde)
	  and then try a backup font name if the first fails.  If that one fails
	  too, it will use 6x13.  In the past, because the AvantGarde, Bookman,
	  HelveticaNarrow, and Palatino fonts were NOT distributed with the X
	  distribution from the Open Group (and the X Consortium before that),
	  xfig would substitute fonts for those, that were close.  Now it will
	  try the correct one and switch to one of the backups if it doesn't
	  exist.
	o FIGAPPS file updated with new information about GNU plotutils
	o Rulers shows fewer ticks for smaller zooms
	o Rulers show more labels between major ticks for larger zooms
	o New floppy disk library object in "Computers"
	o New firewall symbol and "generic hardware" library objects in "Networks"
	  from Tomi Ollila (Tomi.Ollila@tfi.net)
	o New "Optics" library includes mirrors, lenses, fiber optics
	  from Kai-MartinKnaak (kmk@abraxas.physik.uni-mainz.de)
	o New Structural Analysis library includes plates, supports, loads, beams,
	  coordinate systems, and trusses.
	  From Roman Putanowicz (putanowr@twins.pk.edu.pl)
	  Please see copyright information in the Structural_Analysis/readme object
	  (Examples/Libraries/Structural_Analysis/readme.fig
	o More descriptive error message about non-existent or old app-defaults
	  file
	o Removed restriction that fonts are ISO8859-1 encoded to allow, e.g.
	  iso646.1991, which is what the scalable Schumacher fonts are.
	o New computers/terminals in Computers library, and new network comp-
	  onents in the Networks library of objects.
	    From T. Sato (VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp).
	o When a compound object containing right- or left-justified text is
	  flipped horizontally, the justification of those text objects is also
	  swapped (i.e. right-justified text becomes left-justified and vice versa)
	o Warning printed if user uses Fig.geometry resource to size main xfig
	  window - should only use -geometry command-line argument or
	  pwidth/pheight args/resources.
	o Uses ANSI stdargs.h instead of varargs.h now
	  From Roland Rosenfeld (roland@spinnaker.de)
	o Spell check command uses "%f now instead of "%s" for filename
	o Can define BINDIR to install xfig in custom directory (see README file)
	o Xfig windows aren't unmapped now when user presses "Edit Image" to edit
	  imported image file (not necessary)
	o When in edit mode and you hit Control-Return inside of a text box rather
	  than just Return, it's a shortcut for DONE.
	  From Jeff Hakner (hak@cooper.edu)
	o When editing a compound object, any text objects in it are shown and
	  editable.
	  From Jeff Hakner (hak@cooper.edu)
	o In library place mode, the change draw mode function was moved to
	  Shift-Middle rather than Shift-Left.  Shift-Left now has the behavior
	  of placing the object and doing an edit on it.  When you conclude the
	  edit, it resumes place mode.  This combined with including the text
	  objects in editing compound objects, allows you to edit any text labels
	  in library objects as they are placed.
	  From Jeff Hakner (hak@cooper.edu)
	o Rotation angle of objects may be floating point now
	  From Marc Joosen (marcj@historia.et.tudelft.nl)
	o Spelling checker and search/replace popup more useful now
	o New "zoom to fit canvas" feature - Ctrl-Z accelerator in canavs will zoom
	  the figure to just fit the canvas.  New button in popup zoom dialog to
	  do same.
	o After closing an open compound, the "Open Compound" mode is selected
	o If the Shift key is held down while mouse button 2 is clicked on an
	  object, any comments in the object are displayed in a popup until the
	  mouse button is released
	o New command-line option -flipvisualhints (resource Fig.flipvisualhints)
	  which will flip left/right mouse indicator messages for mice whose
	  buttons have been switched.
	o New import picture formats supported - TIFF and PPM 
	o Added -hiddentext and -rigidtext command-line options and X resources
	  to fill out the text flags options (first was -specialtext)

BUGS FIXED:
	o In "move point" mode, mouse button 3 incorrectly labelled as "Locate
	  Object", when in fact no function is associated with that button
	o Error reading GIF header under certain circumstances
	o For JPEG and GIF export, -g option was being passed to fig2dev even
	  with no background color selected
	o Exporting to PDF using xfig actually exported to PS.  Fig2dev does the
	  correct thing, though.
	o Depth manager didn't update correctly if depth between two other
	  depths was removed (e.g. when deleteing an object of depth 51 leaving
	  only depths 50 and 52, the indicator for depth 51 wasn't removed from
	  the display)
	o PAPER_A4 pointed to A9 entry
	o Docmentation incorrectly mentioned "page_size" when it should say
	  "paper_size" (Doc/html/options.html)
	o Split line didn't work on ArcBox
	o Opening a compound object, changing an object inside, closing the
	  compound then pressing "Undo" would result in the original object
	  outside the compound, plus the changed object still inside, and would
	  then eventually segfault if the compound was operated on in any way.
	o Imakefile didn't install pdf files as advertised with "make install"
	o "XEvent event" missing from input tablet code in main.c
	o If xfig tried to import a compressed image file and the directory was
	  not writable, it segfaulted while trying to close an unopen file
	o Inadvertantly removed "Help/Xfig man pages" menu entry
	o Wrong path for installation of the xfig-howto.pdf file
	o Bad hyperlink for "Help Menu" in html docs
	o Fig files with "#FIG" but no version number crashed xfig
	o "Show depth manager" missing from screenshot and description of global
	  settings
	o Background color for exporting didn't have "None" option
	o PDF export ignored centering, background color and multiple pages
	  options
	o Warnings from fig2dev weren't displayed when exporting
	o Various command-line options missing from man pages and html docs
	o When turning on or off the depth manager the canvas needed refreshing
	o Symbol "MAXCOMLEN" defined by xfig is already used on some systems
	o Character array illegally freed in screen capture procedure
	o There is a less restrictive copyright on the html pages.  Instead of:
	    "However, you may not modify any part of this documentation
	    without explicit permission of T.Sato or Brian V. Smith."
	  there is now:
	    "Modification of this documentation is also granted as long as
	    this copyright notice remain intact and name of the person who made
	    the modification is explicitly written in the documentation.
	    However, contact to T.Sato and/or Brian V. Smith is strongly
	    recommended if you want to distribute modified version of this
	    documentation."
	o "Smart links" wasn't working when copying compound object with link -
	  the link wasn't copied
	o Preview figure wasn't freeing memory
	o Text lines with trailing carriage returns (^M) were read incorrectly
	  from .fig file, causing following object lines to be included with the
	  text object
	o Some calls to free_spline were passing wrong type of pointer
	  Fixed by Bradley Kuszmaul (bradley@ee.yale.edu)
	o Call to init_point_array shouldn't have arguments
	  Fixed by Bradley Kuszmaul (bradley@ee.yale.edu)
	o Changing to/from PostScript and LaTeX font type using the update
	  button didn't work unless "update text flags" was also enabled
	o The CompKeyDB file didn't get installed correctly if user specified
	  a path for DESTDIR (normally empty).
	o arrowhead thickness/width/height were being truncated to integers in
	  popup edit panel
	o was using /tmp instead of TMPDIR env variable for xfig cut file if
	  user .xfig file couldn't be used
	o cleaned up routines that "show line lengths" while drawing/moving
	  objects (-showlengths).  Much less detritus now.
	o bug when allocating more user colors than colortable can handle
	o message string not large enough for some of the balloons for the
	  attribute panel. From Martin Kroeker
	o Fixed bug in arc arrows introduced when units for arrowhead width and
	  height were changed to be the same as for arrowhead thickness
	o Pie-wedge arcs can no longer have arrowheads.
	o In the popup edit panel, if no numeric value was in either the fill
	  intensity or fill pattern entry and carriage return was pressed, an
	  illegal value might have appeared there
	o Filename sometimes trashed when trying to call external image editor
	  from edit popup on imported picture
	o If the text mode is selected followed by the "Paste" mode, xfig would
	  segfault
	o Another change to the "make install.doc" and "make install.libs"
	  because some systems' install program can only take one file at a time
	o "make install.doc" doesn't install the Japanese html files unless I18N
	  is set in the Imakefile (Internationalization)
	o If Fig.ad isn't installed, xfig died because "browser" or "pdfviewer"
	  resources were NULL
	o Mouse function indicator wasn't being reset for cancel library popup
	o Cancelling the library popup wasn't quite working
	o If preview of any library object failed, user couldn't place any more
	  library objects
	o Typing characters other than 'r', 'l', 'h', and 'v' are ignored when
	  placing library objects on canvas
	o When calling external image editor (via "edit image" from importing
	  picture object), argument list[0] wasn't name of image editor
	o When using the external image editor on an imported picture, xfig
	  compared the file modification time before and after to re-read it if
	  it changed, however the modification time before the edit was never
	  obtained
	o Moved JPEGINCDIR definition in the Imakefile up with the #ifdef USEJPEG
	  for easier access
	o Bug in code which redisplays canvas sometimes left ghosts behind if a
	  "move object" was cancelled
	o Center/Flushleft setting was not properly set from figure file
	o Align-to-canvas assumed US Size A or ISO A4 paper instead of using the
	  current page size from export/print
	o Objects with large coordinates (e.g. 190000 Fig units) were drawn
	  incorrectly because of a peculiarity in either the X server or the
	  X Drawing procedures that didn't work correctly for screen coords >
	  16000.
	o If the canvas was either refreshed or zoomed while previewing a file,
	  things failed miserably
	o Line counter corrected when reading Fig file.  Was in error sometimes
	  when reporting bad input lines.
	o Fill patterns (e.g. bricks, vertical lines etc.) were not zoomed
	  correctly in figure preview
	o INLINE definition changed from "inline" to "__inline" to satisify DEC
	  Unix or Irix and Solaris OSs
	o Removed all "NullParameter" from Imakefile because OpenWindows doesn't
	  have it
	o Changed XPointer to XVisualInfo * in call to XFree in main.c for those
	  still running OpenWindows
	o The "About Xfig" window didn't trap for "Delete Window" so a window
	  manager that substitutes "Destroy Window" in that case would kill xfig
	o If user is previewing a figure (in the popup file panel) and the canvas
	  needs to be redrawn it is deferred until the preview is finished,
	  preventing the Bad Window error previously seen.
	o Doesn't segfault now if no app-defaults file is installed
	o Bug fixed where a rotated string with only blanks (spaces) would segfault
	o Mask for attribute panel button management changed to unsigned long to
	  insure 32-bit values
	o When reading in a figure containing an image, any offset in the file panel
	  was applied to the SIZE of the image.  This is obviously incorrect.
	o When cancelling the file panel during a file preview xfig would sometimes
	  die with an X error.
	  Fix from Patrick Gosling (jpmg@eng.cam.ac.uk)
	o There was a bug when converting Fig 3.1 splines to 3.2 under certain
	  circumstances
	o Changed fig.h to always include (sys/param.h)
	o Various function mis-declarations and signed/unsigned casts fixed by
		Jonathan R. Ferro (jferro@corwin.ece.cmu.edu)
	o Bug in image capture fixed by
		Jonathan R. Ferro (jferro@corwin.ece.cmu.edu)
	o Not really a bug, but a change in default - define HAVE_NO_DIRENT
	  in the Imakefile if your system DOESN'T have dirent.h
	o When browsing pictures in the import picture interface, if you single-
	  click on a filename and then close the browse panel, it now applies that
	  picture.  In the past you had to double-click on a filename to apply it.
	o Cleaned up error reporting of line numbers in Fig file
	o cur_dir[] array in mode.c wasn't large enough (changed to PATH_MAX)
	  From Martin Pahl (pahl@tnt.uni-hannover.de)
	o Hidden, Rigid, and Special text flags weren't updated correctly with
	  update tool
	o -international and -inputStyle added to help message.
	o Multiple page option was being turned off but pulldown menu showed
	  otherwise
	o If the user changes directories in the file/open panel but then presses
	  "cancel", the original directory is restored now
	o Stops parsing library directories when limit is reached
	o Doc/FORMAT3.2 file (and all previous) incorrectly described the bounding
	  box for compound objects as having upper-right and lower-left values,
	  when in fact they have upper-*left* and lower-*right* bound values
	o On a PseudoColor server, with xfig in -mono mode, it attempted to store
	  a color illegally
	o Editing of comments for picture objects wasn't retained
	o Library directory now may include files with more than just .fig in name
	  (e.g. .fig.gz, .fig.Z, etc).  Also, explicit check is made to ensure that
	  whatever matches *.fig* isn't a directory.
	o Missing quote for MKDIRHIER variable in Imakefile:
	  XCOMM MKDIRHIER = "/bin/sh /usr/bin/X11/mkdirhier"
	o When using small icons, xfig would still use 3 buttons per row on small
	  screens even when not necessary.
	o Allocation error in reading some pcx files
	o Bug in HSV color sliders when clicking left or right (increase/descrease)
	  mouse button
	o Bug in HSV color sliders on 16bpp PseudoColor visuals

---------------------------------
Patchlevel 2 (July 2, 1998)

BUGS FIXED:
	o Placing a library object caused xfig to die after recursing for a
	  long time
	o Arrowheads in xfig 2.x files were incorrectly converted to 3.2.1
	  (they came out too large)
	o Imakefile didn't properly install Electrical/Physical and
	  Electrical/Schematic directories
	o Some variables multiply defined in u_draw.c
	o Some systems' "install" program don't have the "-d" (create directory)
	  option so I have reworked the install part of the Imakefile

---------------------------------
Patchlevel 1 Final (July 1, 1998)

NEW FEATURES:
	o Preview of figure is created when you single click on a filename
	  in the popup file panel. It also shows the size of the figure.
	o Library feature - load a library of Fig objects and pick and place
	  objects from the library on the canvas where you want.
	  See the man pages for details, and see Examples/Libraries for some
	  examples.  From Stephane Mancini (mancini@elecsrv.enst.fr) with
	  modifications by Brian V. Smith
	o Preview of library objects in library popup similar to figure preview
	  by Brian Smith
	o The library objects in the Electrical and Logic libraries were done
	  by Peter Hiscocks (phiscock@ee.ryerson.ca)
	o Xfig tutorial (PDF) in Doc/xfig-howto.pdf.  Also available from the
	  Help menu. Written by Peter Hiscocks (phiscock@ee.ryerson.ca)
	o "make install" installs the Fig object libraries to the library
	  directory.
	  The default is $XFIGLIBDIR/Libraries (/usr/lib/X11/xfig/Libraries),
	  which may be changed in the Imakefile.
	o When pasting a Fig object from the xfig cut buffer it appears under
	  the mouse (or near the mouse if pressing the "Paste" button) where
	  it may then be moved around on the canvas before pressing mouse
	  button 1 to place it.
	o Unit box in upper-right corner now shows the scale (e.g. 1cm=3km)
	  This necessitated making the top ruler a little narrower to make the
	  unitbox fit.  If the mode panel is on the right side, the side ruler
	  is made wider to fit the unit box above it.
	o The path of imported pictures is saved as relative path if picture is
	  in subdirectory of main figure file, else it is saved as absolute.
	  from T. Sato
	o When drawing a line, moving a point on a line, or adding a point to
	  the end of a line, the angle to horizontal is shown in the message
	  window
	o Pressing <Meta>-I turns on and off new feature that draws red
	  horizontal and vertical lines near the line you are drawing, or point
	  you are moving, to indicate rise and run.  Also, the length is shown
	  next to and above the horizontal and vertical line respectively, and
	  the actual length of the line is shown near the line itself.
	  The command-line argument -showlengths (resource Fig.showlengths) will
	  enable this feature as xfig starts.
	o Print popup button is active even when print panel is up which makes
	  it easy to force it to the top of the window stack if it is hidden
	o Pressing the File button in the command panel while the Export panel
	  is up will popdown the export panel and popup the file panel.  The
	  converse is also true - if the Export button is pressed while the file
	  panel is up, the file panel will be popped down and the export panel
	  is popped up.
	o When merging a file/figure into the current figure it is made into
	  a compound object first
	o Merging a figure keeps the file panel up to be able to merge more
	  figures
	o Better memory allocation for temporary arrays when drawing objects -
	  may be slightly faster now
	  from T. Sato
	o Freehand line/polygon drawing - use mouse button 2 to start after
	  choosing polyline.  As the mouse is moved points are added to the
	  line or polygon.
	  NOTE - this changes the line drawing behaviour:  Mouse button 3 is
	  now used to create a single-point object.
	o Whole window screen capture in addition to area capture in picture
	  object popup.  The behaviour of the mouse has changed with this -
	  Mouse button 1 captures whole window now and mouse button 2 is used
	  to capture area of screen.
	o Characters added to Fig*browse_panel*mask*string to include .tif
	  and .sld files
	o If xfig is started without a filename, the default filename is empty
	  instead of unnamed.fig.  This forces the file panel popup when save
	  is done, to enter a new file name.
	o Variable time delay for popup information balloons, specified in
	  milliseconds (-balloon_delay; resource Fig.balloon_delay)
	o If you enlarge the File, Export or Library panels only the file list
	  area is enlarged to show more files
	o New "spinner" widgets to increment/decrement values in popup indicator
	  entries (e.g. line thickness indicator popup)
	o Option of using either absolute values for arrowhead sizes or multiple
	  of current line length (see arrow size popup)
  	o Arrowhead thickness, width and height can be set explicitely in
  	  bottom panel for creating arrowheads.  Update button also copies
  	  arrowhead size info to/from objects and indicator panel.
	  The arrowhead width and height parameters are now the same units as
	  the arrowhead thickness, which is units of line thickness, not 1/1200
	  inch as they were in previous versions of xfig.
	o Color popup menu in popup edit panel handles lots of colors better
	o Option of smaller icons for the mode panel (left side) by compiling with
	  USESMALLICONS in Imakefile.  See the Imakefile for details. Also see
	  Fig.ad.  Look for "icons".
	  From Andrew Morgan (morgan@physics.ucla.edu)
	o New grid and point positioning setting at 1/8" (or 2mm in metric mode)
	o When moving, copying, moving a point of or adding a point to objects,
	  all the "grab corners" of the other objects in the figure disappear
	  to make the figure less cluttered.  They reappear when the operation
	  is complete.
	o Pull-down menu buttons have an arrow icon to show that it is a pull-down
	o Units such as "i" for inches and "c" for cm may be entered following
	  coordinates in popup edit panel for editing objects (e.g. 3c for 3 cm)
	  From Rick Richardson (rick@dgii.com)
	o When importing a picture file (eps, GIF, etc) xfig is more intelligent
	  and faster about deciding the format
	o "Integer area zoom" option in zoom popup - if checked, when using the
	  mouse to zoom an area of the canvas, the zoom amount will be an integral
	  value (e.g. 2, 3, 4)
	o Compose key LED may be turned on for multi-key characters (e.g.
	  a-umlaut etc) on Sun Sparcstations.  See README file about COMP_LED.
	  from Hans Werner Strube (strube@swing.physik3.gwdg.de)
	o New fig2dev driver for tk (tcl/tk) - Generates tk canvas and canvas
	  objects.  From Mike Markowski (mm@udel.edu)
	o Added "Alt" key definitions to the accelerators in Fig.ad to accomodate
	  those machines which don't have a Meta key

BUGS FIXED:
	o Line width is scaled with object scaling now
	o Arrowheads are scaled when scaling lines, splines and arcs now
	o Screen_res was incorrect for drawing tablets
	o When scaling a compound by using the "move point" edit mode, undoing
	  the scale didn't work properly because of rounding problems.
	  A proper "undo" is now performed.
	o Note: the -inverse (reverse video) option has been removed because
	  the same effect can be achieved using "-cbg black -cfg white"
	o Made the export_panel*mask*string same as browse_panel*mask*string
	o User-defined colors weren't being merged properly in compound objects
	o If Paste was performed while opening a compound object, some objects
	  outside the opened compound object may have been lost and xfig may
	  have crashed with a segfault later.
	o ARC-BOX corner radius scaled incorrectly when box was scaled
	o ARC-BOX corner radius is now only scaled with Scale operation, not
	  move point
	o Busy cursor wasn't being reset when reading some figures
	o Refreshing the screen while creating a Fig object (e.g. POLYLINE)
	  refreshes that object correctly now
	o Updated pointer for hp2xx and additional pointer to Fig related apps
	  in FIGAPPS file. From Ian MacPhedran
	o Declaration of clrtab array incorrect in f_neuclrtab.h - caused
	  problems on Digital Unix. From Ian MacPhedran
	o When loading a figure that changes the canvas orientation (Portrait/
	  Landscape), the file modified flag was not cleared
	o When it can't save to a file, xfig now rings the bell and puts the
	  error message in the *popup* message window
	o Trying to use the external image editor in the edit panel for an
	  imported picture failed if the file was compressed
	o When switching to a private colormap because of importing a picture,
	  xfig is better about matching the colormap of the popup edit panel
	o Objects not aligned correctly in large drawings due to bad choice
	  of starting min/max values (use INT_MIN and INT_MAX now)
	o When running "xfig -right" (mode/edit panel on right-side) the popup
	  balloons were too long, never showed the message and popped up and
	  down because they appeared under the mouse.
	o Cleanup of many, many function declarations (mostly type void)
	o Inadvertantly used incorrect font for Avant-Garde
	o When undo'ing load figure, any objects using user-defined colors may
	  not have been displayed correctly until doing a "Redraw".  Also,
	  non-existant user colors may have stayed in pen and/or fill color
	  indicators.
	o Bug in size of imported Picture when clicking on "Use orig size" -
	  image was slightly too small.  Also bug when clicking "Use orig size"
	  in metric mode - even worse scaling.
	o Code to check for bad font numbers when reading Fig file was in wrong
	  place
	o Bug in pcx decoder - odd-width images caused seg fault.  This would
	  also affect importing eps files since xfig uses pcx output from gs.
	o Another bug in pcx decoder - wasn't allocating correct amount of memory
	  for the image buffer.  This would of course, cause segfaults.
	o Bug in "Fit-to-page" in metric mode fixed
	  from Hans Werner Strube (strube@swing.physik3.gwdg.de)
	o Cleaned up mode button icons to fit within button area better
	o An old feature to prevent an expose event on the canvas from erasing
	  a newly imported image while still in the picture editor is no longer
	  needed and prevented screen refreshing
	o If screen capture is attempted with no Fig filename (e.g. when
	  starting xfig with no file name) seg fault occurred.
	  from T. Sato
	o Small correction to I18N draw_string routine
	  from T. Sato
	o Not all calls to fig2dev had I18N localization options passed
	  from T. Sato
	o If you create a new figure (no name yet) and try to export before
	  saving, xfig asked you if you wanted to save the figure first.  If
	  you said yes, it would popup the file panel to choose a name and save.
	  After that though, it wouldn't do the export as you first requested.
	  This has been fixed.
	o Added && !defined(__GLIBC__) to declarations of random and srandom for
	  systems with glibc
	o Imported eps files containing "initgraphics" commands weren't working
	  correctly.  This has been fixed by defining initgraphics and
	  initmatrix as {}.
	o Yet another #if added to the never-ending list.  This one is for
	  sys_errlist.  FreeBSD systems already define it in stdio.h.
	o Inconsistent declaration uncompress_file (static)
	o Missing braces around initializers for headers structure for imported
	  bitmap file types
	o Some unused variables and procedures removed
	o Incorrect casts in e_align.c
	o Bug in figure size in export and print panels - bounding variable
	  was clobbered soon after being calculated
	o Allowed saving over a read-only file if file panel wasn't created
	o Various problems with New figure->Export->File popup sequence either
	  segfaulting or permanently disabling xfig buttons and canvas fixed.
	o GC wasn't properly setup for dragging rectangle on screen for screen
	  capture for some systems.
	o Very small arcs "blew up" making very large arcs on screen
	o Bug in draw_arc() - would free unallocated memory if arc was small
	o Imakefile had w_icons.o in XFIGSRC instead of w_icons.c
	o Fixed annoying warning about StartScroll action not found on Linux
	  systems that use the "modified" Xaw3d widget set (ARROW_SCROLLBAR
	  defined, which makes the scrollbars look like the Windows scrollbars)
	o Mouse indicator was leaving bits of old text behind for long messages
	o Removed call to rint() because gcc can't find it on HP-UX
	o Move_point_selected() called set_mousefun() with too few args
	o Variable "text_translations" multiply defined
	o Fixed some bugs relating to updating dash-length/dot-gap in indicator
	  panel from dashed/dotted lines
	o Bug fixed where update indicator (red box) didn't always toggle correctly
	o Undo of spline<->line conversion and box<->arc_box fixed
	o For some reason, the Solaris version of XtAppCreateShell references
	  an argument beyond what the users specifies in the command line,
	  causing a seg fault.
	  Fixed by Martin Pahl (pahl@tnt.uni-hannover.de)
	o Renamed suffix for AutoCad Slide export to ".sld" (was ".acad")
	o Needed #ifdef USE_JPEG in w_export.c for compiling without JPEG
	  support
	o Transparent color was not passed to fig2dev for GIF output (new -t
	  option in fig2dev do do this)
	o Inappropriate arguments to sqrt() in spline calculations (not double)
	o The radius value displayed in the message window was incorrect when
	  drawing ellipses
	o Both radii are reported now when drawing ellipses
	o Now checks whether Fig file is read-only before renaming to .bak and
	  allowing user to save. (after second save, original, read-only file
	  would be gone)
	o New #ifdef for glibc which already has sys_errlist and random() defined
	o Conflict with definition M_PI (3.14159....) on RedHat systems fixed
	o Interpolated splines in Fig version 2.1 files were read incorrectly
	  fixed by Onno Roep (O.A.Roep@twi.tudelft.nl)
	o If you had a line with arrowhead(s) and deleted all the points to make
	  it a single point object, then undid the last delete point, the
	  arrowhead(s) didn't reappear.  This has been fixed.
	o Less multiple redrawing of figure when starting xfig with filename and
	  it needs to change orientation (portrait/landscape)
	o "Ledger" paper size removed from list of paper sizes.  It is really
	  "Tabloid" size in landscape mode.
	o Undo of align to canvas wasn't refreshing display

=============================================================================
Version 3.2 (first release Aug 22, 1997)
=============================================================================

GENERAL NOTE:
 	Because Unisys Corp. has stated that they will not charge royalties for
 	the use of the LZW compression algorithm in *FREE* programs, xfig will
 	continue to support importing and exporting of GIF images.
 	However, be aware that if you sell xfig, for example as part of a CD-ROM
 	package with freeware, you may be liable for paying royalties to Unisys.
 	You may comment out the USEGIF variable in the Imakefile to avoid this.
 	With USEGIF commented out, xfig will still import GIF files, but not
 	export in that format.  Also, for screen capture, xfig will create a PCX
	file instead of a GIF file.
 	*** The authors of xfig and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
 	cannot be held responsible in any case. ***

NOTE:	fig2dev now handles the exporting to bitmap formats (GIF, JPEG etc)
	  instead of xfig, so there is more consistent output. Requires the
	  netpbm package and ghostscript.  See the README file.

NEW FEATURES:
	o Japanese text objects (i18n) availble using flag I18N in Imakefile
	    from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o ppm, tiff (no compression) and AutoCad (acad) output languages added
	o Image quality (0-100) is selectable for JPEG export
	o Figure size (in inches or cm) is shown in the export and print panels,
	  taking into account current magnification
	o "Fit to page" button sets magnification so that figure size will just
	  fill current paper size with (at least) 1/2 inch margin all around
	o Emergency save file renamed from xfig.SAVE to SAVE.fig
	o When doing a screen capture for a picture object, the filename of
	  the capture is the name of the figure file + the time according
	  to time(3) + .gif, e.g. myfigure_858367466.gif
	o Xfig version number in app-defaults file is checked and warning
	    message appears if older than current version
	o Spell checker to find misspelled words in text objects
	    from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Search and replace - search for strings and either replace them with
	    new string or update settings like color, etc. on matched strings
	    from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Exporting to pstex does both PostScript and LaTeX part in one step
	    to file.pstex and file.pstex_t respectively
	o Popup messages (balloons):
	    o describes drawing/editing function when mouse passes over
	      any drawing/editing button
	    o describes how to activate unit/scale popup when mouse passes over
	      units box (where the rulers meet)
	    o describes mouse function indicator when mouse passes over it
	    o describes each command button in top row as mouse passes over
	      buttons
	    o toggle button labelled "Balloons" to turn on/off the balloon
	      messages
	   o all have configurable colors; see Fig-color.ad
	o New figures in Examples directory from Bill Chimiak (chim@bgsm.edu):
		1. clp_computer1.fig - computer equipment clipart
		2. clp_hospit_equip.fig - hospital equipment clipart
		3. clp_network.fig - updated network equipment clipart
		4. musicnotes.fig - musical notes, scale lines and clef
	o Checks version number in app-default file with xfig version and warns
	   if file is older

BUGS FIXED:
	o Arrowheads on splines didn't always point correctly (fig2dev did the
	  right thing, though)
	o Accomodation for 15-bit visual (believe it or not!)
	o Checks bits-per-pixel for image formats because some vendors use 32 bits
	  for 24 bit depths
	o Minor difference in A0 and A1 page sizes
	o Changed XPM variables to default X include/library in Imakefile
	o Path added to save filename when xfig makes emergency save
	o Incorrect email address for xfig-bugs in man page (should be
	  xfig-bugs@epb1.lbl.gov)
	o Typo about font_flags bit number for LaTeX vs PostScript in
	  Doc/FORMAT3.2 file
	o Not enough space allocated for buf[] in create_print_panel()
	  and create_export_panel()
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Typo in Doc/FORMAT3.2 file about header information in Fig files
	o Typo in man pages - zooming uses only CONTROL key, changing spline
	  shape factor requires both CONTROL and SHIFT keys.
	o Justification and page size are now disabled with EPS export
	o Undo of converting spline to line caused seg fault
	o Added #ifdef USE_GIF around transparent color in export and read file
	o Error in sprintf format (was %4.2lf - should be %4.2f) in bottom
	  indicator panel buttons that have floats
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Center of pie-wedge style arc wasn't included in bounding box
	  from Andy Thomas (alt@picnic.demon.co.uk)
	o Better handling of mouse function indicator
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o If "edit spline point" panel is popped up before general edit panel,
	  'Warning: Action not found: apply' appeared when edit panel was
	  later opened
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Actions that had same names renamed to unique names
	  from T.Sato (VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp)
	o Mouse button 1 and 3 didn't scroll the H, S, or V sliders in the color
	  edit panel
	o Unsigned/signed char pointer mix in create_pic_pixmap and
	  get_canvas_clipboard
	o Cleanup of dictionary wrapped around imported EPS files
	  from Franz Koch (franz.koch@zdv.uni-tuebingen.de)
	o Portrait/Landscape changes didn't properly toggle width/height
	o New font specified in app-defaults for those systems whose default
	  font was too large for popup panels (Fig*Font: 7x13bold)
	o Zooming not allowed if drawing object in progress (panning is OK)
	o strcasecmp and strncasecmp bugs (s2 != '\0' and s2 == '\0' should
	  be *s2 ...)
	o When exporting to bitmap format, bounding box of figure was rounded
	  to current point positioning grid (unintended)
	o Unaligned access errors on 64-bit machines (e.g. Alpha) when importing
	  bitmap pictures.  Now uses unsigned int for pointers
	o Code to remove identical consecutive points in line objects had bug
	o Workaround for long-time Intrinsics bug with scrolling text widget in
	  viewport for file and export lists provided by
	  Mark London (mrl@psfc.mit.edu)
	o Bug in control-key-button-1 zoom sequence - didn't allow control key
	  pressed when completing zoom operation
	o Mis-named fonts for zapf chancery and zapf dingbats (many servers don't
	  have these fonts anyway so please don't ask me where to get them)
	o Error in JPEGINC variable in Imakefile - had leading "/" in path
	o Width of "open compound" button was slightly too large such that
	  the mode panel (left) obscured part of the indicator panel (bottom)
	  when -but_per_row was 3
	o Transparent color for GIF export wasn't "None" as default
	o Box objects read in from Fig file would only have three points on
	  some machines
	o Grid wasn't changed to metric when loading metric figure
	o 24- and 32-bit export to JPEG was incorrect
	o "rotate and copy" for text placed first copy correctly, but subsequent
	  copies incorrectly
	o Comments after #FIG before end of header weren't parsed correctly
	o Landscape/Portrait is only available for PostScript export
	o Ledger/Tabloid sizes reversed (Tabloid is 11x17", Ledger is 17x11")
	o Deleting all objects (Meta-D) prevented the "New figure" function
	  by keeping the original figure name
	o Arrowheads were inadvertantly allowed for closed splines via the popup
	  edit panel
	o Picture objects rotated 90 or 270 degrees were also flipped
	o Changed sense of USEINLINE so default is NOT to use it

--------------------------
V3.2 Beta 1 (Jan, 9, 1997)
--------------------------

NEW EXAMPLE FILES (Examples/ directory)

    o fantastic figure from Robort Ford (rford@mailserv.mta.ca):
	transit.fig	- transit map of Saint John, New Brunswick (Canada)
			  Don't use it for locating transit routes - it is only
			  good through July 1996 and only shows non-rush-hour
			  routes
    o great figures from Carlo Kopp (carlo@cs.monash.edu.au):
	greenpig.fig	- F/RF-111C/G Tactical Fighter
	rfxc.fig	- RFX Strike/Recon Fighter
	lidar.fig	- Sidelooking battlefield surveillance LIDAR
	sowpig.fig	- RAAF F-111C fighter jet w/ 2x AGM-142 Have Nap SOWs
    o some nice figures from Peter Hiscocks (phiscock@ee.ryerson.ca)
	aircraft.fig	- light aircraft
	ps-foil.fig	- power supply circuit board foil layout
	ps-schematic.fig - power supply circuit board schematic
    o from Philipp Reisner (Austria).
	Linuxlogo.fig	- the only entry in the Linux 2.0 Logo contest to be
			  rendered with xfig - Unfortunately, it didn't win :-(
    o new clip art objects from W. Chimiak (chim@tachyon.medeng.wfu.edu):
	clp_computer.fig - various computers, monitors etc.
	clp_network.fig	- computer network components
    o more new example files (done by me, Brian Smith)
	3dhouse.fig	- cutaway view of a simple house drawn in 3D
	ctrlbox_lay.fig	- dimensioned drawing of a control box for a project in my group
	ctrlbox_sch.fig	- electrical schematic of the control box

NEW FEATURES

o better error reporting from ghostscript when importing EPS files
o in color popop panel, "lookup color" button allows user to grab color from
	any window for user-defined color in xfig
	uses code from xpaint (Copyright 1993 David Koblas (koblas@netcom.com)
	and Copyright 1995, 1996 Torsten Martinsen (bullestock@dk-online.dk))
o There is a new mathematical model for splines. The new version uses X-splines
	which allows to mix interpolation and approximation points in a same
	curve. More precisely, it means that an X-spline curve is neither an
	interpolated spline nor an approximated one, it is BOTH (the behaviour
	of each point is controlled by one single parameter called "shape
	factor"). For additional information about X-splines, see:

	  "X-Splines: A Spline Model Designed for the End User"
	  by C. Blanc and C. Schlick, Proceedings of SIGGRAPH'95

  o the shape factor of each individual point can be modified interactively
    with a dialog box that is displayed when pressing the right button in
    the EDIT OBJECT mode.
  o the shape factor can also be modified in any of the EDIT modes, by
    holding down the CONTROL key while pressing the mouse buttons.
  o because the CONTROL modifier is used for the shape factor edition,
    the zoom rectangle is now obtained by pressing the SHIFT key AND the
    CONTROL key while dragging the rectangle.
  o new features have been added in the CONVERT mode. Any conversion between
    polylines, polygons, open splines and closed splines are now possible.

    *** Caveat: Because spline models of previous versions (quadratic B-splines
    and Bezier with hidden points) are no longer supported, curves that are
    present in version 3.1 and older files are automatically converted to
    X-splines. This translation is only an approximation process. It means
    that the converted curves are not exactly the same as the original ones.
    Though the translation usually provides almost identical curves, some
    hand-fitting may be needed in some pathological cases.

    The new spline features were written by Carole Blanc (blanc@labri.u-bordeaux.fr)
    and Christophe Schlick (schlick@labri.u-bordeaux.fr) starting from an initial
    implementation done by C. Feuille, S. Grosbois, L. Maziere and L. Minihot as
    a student practice (Universite Bordeaux, France).

o the file format (protocol) has changed (see Doc/FORMAT3.2 for details). This
	means you must also get transfig 3.2. Xfig will still read older Fig
	format files but will always write the new format.
o multiple page flag, paper size, transparent color (GIF export) and print/
	export magnification now stored in Fig file (new protocol format 3.2)
o export/print magnification now command-line argument (-magnification) and
	resource (Fig.Magnification)
o paper size now command-line argument (-paper_size) and resource
	(Fig.paper_size)
o multiple page flag now command-line argument (-multiple) and resource
	(Fig.Multiple) (-single is default)
o option of transparent color for GIF export (e.g. make background transparent)
o new colors in Fig-color.ad resource file from Joel D. Young
	(jdyoung@afit.af.mil).  If you want the old colors, copy Fig-color.old.ad
	to your app-defaults directory as "Fig-color".
o works with GrayScale, TrueColor, DirectColor, StaticColor and StaticGray
	visuals now.  Use "-visual <visualname>" command-line argument or
	"Fig.visual: <visualname>".  Also, "-depth <depth>" (Fig.depth: <depth>)
	supported.
	thanks to help from Kevin Russell (krussell@dres.dnd.ca)
o "Delete All" button changed to "New" function - all objects are delete and
	the current filename is cleared.  Also, the file save and load shortcuts
	will force the file panel to popup if the current filename is empty.
	This will prevent a user from doing a "delete all" to create a new
	figure and forgetting to change the filename when saving.
o new edit features when entering text on canvas:
	Left arrow key and Control-B moves cursor left
	Right arrow key and Control-F moves cursor right
	Home key and Control-A moves cursor to beginning of text
	End key and Control-E moves cursor to the end of text
	Delete key and Control-D delete the character to the right of the cursor
	Control-K deletes from the cursor to the end of the text
	Pan operations using the arrows and the Home key are disabled during
	text entry because they are used for positioning the text cursor now.
o "Open Compound" operation to temporarily go inside a compound object to edit
	individual components.  Can enter nested compounds. Close compound to
	group objects back into compound.
	Written by Bill Taylor (bill@mainstream.com)
o xfig will now automatically unzip/uncompress Fig files with .Z, .z or .gz
	suffixes automatically.  It does not recompress/zip them when saving,
	though.
o -zoom (resource Fig.zoom) option to start xfig at any zoom value
o -startposnmode (resource Fig.startposnmode) option to start xfig with point
	positioning mode specified. Values can be 0 ("any") to 4 (1 inch/20mm).
o size of blank area (margin) around figure when exporting to bitmap-style
	formats (e.g. GIF, XPM etc.) is settable in export window now
o when zooming larger, spacing of dots in grid lines stays constant
o button to hide/show hidden directories (names that begin with ".") in file
	popup menus
o paper size selectable for printing and when exporting to PS/EPS:
	"Letter", "Legal", "Ledger", "Tabloid", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "A0",
	"A1", "A2", "A3", "A4" and "B5"
o in the past if an ellipse was scaled such that the radii become equal it was
	"converted" to a circle.  This "feature" has been removed.
o point objects (POLYLINES with only one point) now have thickness, as they
	should.  Additionally, if the cap style is rounded, they will be filled
	circles
o when exporting figure containing picture objects, xfig warns if the export
	filename is the same as any of the picture files
o note explaining how metric units are defined in xfig in the Doc/FORMAT3.1 file
o when updating objects with update button, they were drawn twice - now they are
	only drawn once
o when deleting xfig window (WM_DELETE_WINDOW), popup confirmation gives user
	the option to save figure
o README file updated to give credit for Example figures not done by Brian Smith
o default suffix for hpgl (ibmgl) export changed to "hpl" for PC users

BUGS FIXED

o smart links didn't work when the box being moved had line thickness > 1
o -exportLanguage ignores case now (e.g. GIF == gif)
o identical consecutive points in lines and "normal" splines are removed as file
	is read into xfig
o some thick arrowheads still protruded into the object they touched (in fig2dev
	too) - fix from Tobias Ringstrom
o resource for compose key database file is keyFile, not ComposeKeyDB (Fig.ad)
o color of labels for color numbers/names in color panel contrast their color
o edit panel allowed > 100% fill for black and white fill
o additional check for bad Bounding Box in imported EPS file
o when flipping objects vertically or horizontally, overlapping objects weren't
	redrawn
o format error in sprintf for temp filename in screen capture (%d should be %ld)
o some versions of imake don't like null parameters in SpecialObjectRule in
	Imakefile - changed to "NullParameter"
o "modified" flag wasn't being set when changing spline<->line or box<->arcbox,
	thus one could quit without saving without xfig confirming
	from Matthias Braun (browny@ise.fhg.de)
o when figure is read in from file, any arrowheads with width, height or
	thickness of 0 are given default values (were causing SIGFPE errors)
o colormap must be saved before jpeg_finish_decompress or
	jpeg_destroy_decompress are called in read_JPEG_file()
o when fore/background colors different from black/white respectively, the fill
	colors for black and white fill were incorrect
o when merging figure with no picture objects into figure with picture objects
	colors were unnecessarily remapped
o "rubberbanding" of object being drawn would continue after object was
	completed.  Also, double clicking on a directory name would cause
	segmentation fault.
	fixed by Stefan Proels (proels@fmi.uni-passau.de)
o Imakefile had error - $(PCXBUG) was incorrectly passed to f_readjpc.c
	instead of f_readeps.c where it was needed
o If the directory path in a file popup was changed by typing into the path
	window but carriage return wasn't pressed, rescan showed the correct
	directory but the path wasn't correct so no files were accessible.
o Redefined $(XPMINCDIR) to $(XPMINC) because some compilers have trouble with
	header search path with empty "-I"
o string allocation errors in string widgets in popup edit panels
o no return code for successful screen capture which would result in failure
	randomly
o picture objects scaled (enlarged) correctly in metric mode so they print 1:1
o incorrect values for white colormap entry when writing jpeg file on
	monochrome display
o Some people have older X11 include files that don't have <unistd.h> included.
	fig.h explicitely includes that now for the SEEK_END identifier
o Not enough space for number strings in rulers (SEG fault)
o circle grab points moved even if no changes made in popup edit of circle or
	ellipse object
o after attempt to do a horiz/vert move point of a circle was disallowed,
	further move points were disabled until edit mode switched
o if both points of "circle-by-diameter" have same y value it thought that the
	edge is the center when you try to use "box scale"
o colormap from jpeg file was referenced after memory was freed
o #include <jpeglib.h> changed to #include "jpeglib.h" to ensure corrrect path
	used to find header file
o problems on Linux with gcc locating old jpeg library even when JPEBLIGDIR
	pointed to local version
o buf too short in set_mixed_names
o line2 too short in button struct
o file not closed after writing JPEG file
o pen color for picture objects disabled for all except XBM (bitmap) in popup
	edit
o confusion with -DNOSTRSTR, NOSTRSTR and HAVE_NO_STRSTR cleaned up. See README.
o possible error in rulers with sprintf %f called with integer expression
o cleaned up add/delete user defined colors - no requirement to click on
	colorcell after "Add Color" to set color sliders
o added condition in Imakefile that f_wrjpg.c depends on jconfig.h (jpeg library)
o changed #include <jpeglib.h> to #include "jpeglib.h" because of search rules
o Version 1.0 of Xaw3d used resources topShadow and bottomShadow for colors of
	those resources.  Version 1.1 uses topShadowPixel and bottomShadowPixel.
	I have included both names in the Fig.ad app-defaults file for
	compatibility.
o removed extraneous comma (,) in length and distance messages when
	drawing/moving objects
o cleaned up many type mismatch warnings for bitmap data
o bug in skip_comment() which prevented some machines from seeing the end of
	file, giving erroneous "Incorrect format" error
o typos in xfig.man in resources StartGridMode, StartPosnMode, StartLineWidth,
	StartFillStyle and StartTextStep (had lowercase 's')
o pcx file was closed twice
o if there is an error when writing screen capture to a file, the popup error
	message window shows the error
o Examples/logo.fig had squished logo eps file
