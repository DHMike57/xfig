Version 2.1
===========

Patchlevel 8 (Oct 1, 1993)
Changes to Patchlevel 7:

NEW FEATURES:

o minimum movement for mountain/manhatten mode reduced from 7 pixels to 2
o lengths/radii of objects now displayed on first click in move point mode, not
	just when actually moving the points
o -DOPENWIN no longer necessary - xfig automatically first uses OpenWindows
	scalable fonts (e.g. times-roman-33) if they are available, X11R5
	scalable fonts next if they are available or non-scaling fonts if
	neither of the above is available.
o maximum radius of arc-boxes increased from 30 to 100 pixels
o icon now shows current filename (without full path)
o Control-L does Redraw when not in text input mode (same as Meta-R)
o popup query to shift whole figure when reading in figure file if any objects
	have negative coordinates
o mouse function window shows pan/zoom operations when control key is pressed
o popup query when exporting figure if figure has not been saved (note: this
	is not necessary for exporting current figure but is a warning to
	the user that the figure hasn't been saved yet)
o BSD-style printing on SYSV machines (like SGI) allowed by setting -DBSDLPR
	in Imakefile/Makefile
	from Dave Goldberg (dsg@blackbird.mitre.org)
o on-screen rotation of text at any angle
	xfig now uses xvertext 5.0 from Alan Richardson which allows rotation
	at any angle. The whole font is not loaded anymore, and strings are
	cached, which speeds up the interactive input of text.
o man pages no longer use .TS (table) commands for those systems whose roff
	doesn't support tables.  Also formatting cleaned up and typos fixed.
	From David W. Sanderson (dws@ssec.wisc.edu)
o double click on filename in File menu will automatically load figure
o double click on filename in Export menu will automatically export figure
o some more information about text objects has been added to the Doc/FORMAT2.1
	file - specificly about the font and font_flags fields
o keyboard accelerators for drawing/editing mode panel.  See Fig.ad for details
	From Tim MacKenzie (tym@dibbler.cs.monash.edu.au)
o Example figure which contains building blocks for making flowcharts - called
	flowchart.fig in the Examples directory (replaces old flowchart.fig)
	from Tim P. Starrin (noid@cyborg.larc.nasa.gov)
o The default is now for xfig to use X11R5 scalable fonts unless the server
	doesn't support them.  The user may still disable them with -noscalable
	or the resource "Fig*scalablefonts: false".
o new button panel in the indicator panel to set/clear or toggle update flags to
	make it easier to control which object attributes are affected by update
o new command-line paramter: -but_per_row (resource But_per_row) specifies the
	number of buttons wide the mode panel should be.  This is useful in
	conjunction with -pheight for small screens to reduce the canvas area.
o no need to add -DNO_SIGBUS to Imakefile for systems without SIGBUS anymore.
	This this is automatic now.

BUG FIXES:

o changing a filled object to unfilled now draws background correctly
o cleaned up inconsistencies with fill colors in monochrome mode
o GC's were being freed twice if window quit was executed (window manager)
o exporting figure to X11 bitmap only exported visible part of canvas
o current directory wasn't set in export popup unless file menu had been popped
	up previously
o units box didn't change from "in" to "cm" or vice versa when changing from
	Imperial to/from Metric
o editing text with popup edit at zoomscale != 1 shows correct text size now
o undo of text delete at another zoomscale shows correct text size now
o colons (:) removed from widget names (difficult to set resources with colons)
o conditional definition of index = strchr (or strchr = index) for those systems
	which already have them defined
o workaround for linux bug where certain 8-bit characters are not read properly
	by sscanf()
	from Alain Lucien Knaff (knaff@mururoa.imag.fr)
o height of cursor for text input closer to actual text height (was "descent+
	ascent" tall, now is "ascent" tall)
o <Meta>L (LoadFile function) didn't query if current figure was modified before
	re-loading file
o if normalFont can't be loaded, "fixed" font is tried - if that fails xfig
	quits with error message
o 8-bit character did not appear on canvas
o semicolon missing from "for" statement in main.c
o caused core dump if the environment variable PRINTER was not set and the
	Fig*printer*string was not set
o -startfontsize parameter wasn't being honored
o quit() function was being called with too few parameters.  This kills xfig
	on OpenWindows servers.
	From David Partain (dlp@ida.liu.se)
o fixed bug with freeing two identical GC's (caused coredump when quitting on
	certain machines)
o fixed bug inadvertently introduced in 2.1.7 which caused some arcs to be drawn
	as circles
o scaling of arc inside compound no longer produces co-linear points
o messages didn't appear in the message panel when filename panel wasn't
	large enough
o parameter missing from call to curve() which made strange half-ellipse for box
	curve radius indicator. Caused massive problems for OpenWindows servers.
o moved two accelerators (SaveFile and LoadFile) from top-level to the File
	widget heirarchy (this was causing OpenWindows servers to eat memory)
o work around for bug in OpenWindows 2.0 with bitmaps in widgets (caused
	BadMatch error when popping up the print panel)
o duplicate .TP in xfig.man caused nroff to throw away the text following the
	"Dismiss" description in the print section
o emptyname() dereferenced null pointer if printer name was NULL
o malloc didn't alloc enough space for fontname + null in w_drawprim.c
o text outline box was sometimes drawn incorrectly
o Renamed ICONFIGFILES (already used by X11 config) to ICONXFIGFILES and defined
	it in Imakefile (it was referenced but undefined)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patchlevel 7 (May 3, 1993)
Changes to Patchlevel 6:

NEW FEATURES:

o Vertical and upside-down text - text with angles of 90, 180 and 270 degrees
	supported. Text between those angles will be drawn with the next 
	higher angle (e.g. 130 degree text will be drawn at 180 degrees).
	from Alan Richardson (mppa3@uk.ac.sussex.syma)
o message panel uses asciiTextWidget so one may select text from it
o does not ask if it is OK to write an existing file during save if it is the
	current figure file that is being saved.  Same for export.
o accelerators to Save or Load file without popping up file menu 
	(default: Meta-S to Save and Meta-L to Load)
o PRINTER environment variable is used if no resource is set for 
	Fig*printer*string
o if an ellipse is scaled such that the radii become equal it is "converted"
	to a circle
o ablity to change to/from imperial and metric with popup menu by hitting
	mouse button 3 in the units box (where rulers meet)
	from Paul King (king@cs.uq.oz.au)
o new command-line parameters -userscale (resource userscale) and -userunit
	(resource userunit) which are used in the on-screen messages which
	show the current length/diameter etc.  This provides a simple way of
	doing scale drawings, e.g. 0.25 inch = 1 ft (userscale=0.25,
	userunit="ft") or 1 cm = 1 m (userscale=1, userunit="m").  These may
	be changed via the popup menu by hitting mouse button 3 in the units
	box (where rulers meet)
o new indicator button allows text flags to be viewed/set
o compiles/runs on DEC Alpha with OSF/1 now
o text widget in the print popup to pass extra parameters to print program
	(lp or lpr as the case may be)
o indicator shows the number of figures in the batch print file in print popup
o automatic on-screen generation of preview bitmap for EPS objects if you have 
	gs (ghostscript) - compile with -DGSBIT flag
	from Michael C. Grant (mcgrant@rascals.stanford.edu) 
	adapted from
	Marc Goldburg's (marcg@rascals.stanford.edu) original idea and code.
o indicator in upper-left corner (under Quit button) shows current filename
o print button changes message from "print FIGURE to printer" to "print BATCH to
	printer" if there are figures in batch file
o when drawing objects or moving/adding points the length/radius/diameter is 
	displayed in the message window
o feature to shift figure on page if it is off the page has been disabled until
	it can be done with option or explicit command
o added -noscalablefonts command-line option to force scalable fonts OFF
	(usually for debugging)

BUG FIXES:

o condition for OSF/1 added to use dirent
	from Dave Hill (ddhill@zk2.dec.com)
o Floating point values allowed for BoundingBox in EPS files
o if user asks for scalable fonts but server doesn't support them, xfig auto-
	matically switches to non-scalable fonts
o when printing to batch file, incorrect filename appeared in message panel
o undo of a text move didn't redraw the text
o <unistd.h> included unnecessarily in f_util.c (X11/Xos.h includes it if 
	necessary). Also, various cleanups with multiply defined cursors etc.
	From Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)
o internalborderwidth resource should be integer not float
o cancel when drawing latex line left unwanted garbage on screen
o put_fmsg removed and put_msg uses varargs now so MIPS machines and others
	should all work fine now
o writing X11 bitmap still had bugs
o text wasn't being rotated around mouse point with rotate mode
o when moving end points of a (sp)line or when adding points to the end
  of a (sp)line, the angle geometry button was not available
o export directory now follows file directory when load/save figure is done
o entering centered text with odd number of characters caused double image
o fixed bug with incorrectly placing text with point positioning on when the
	text was originally created with point positioning off
o when moving centered or right-justified zoomed text grab point was shifted
o rotated ellipses panned incorrectly
o centering/flush-left options in Export menu were reversed
o flipped EPS objects weren't being flipped properly when reading in figure
o GC's weren't being freed when xfig finished
o added Titan OS (Stardent) to list of machines needing getenv() and atof() 
	explicitely defined (not in /usr/include/... file )
	from Joachim Wiesel (wiesel@ipf.bau-verm.uni-karlsruhe.de)
o underscores weren't showing in text line in popup edit
	from Daniel Faigin (faigin@aero.org)
o old text outline wasn't being erased
	from Daniel Faigin (faigin@aero.org)
o number[] array wasn't large enough for new 3-character numbers in the rulers
	from Andrew Haylett (ajh@gec-mrc.co.uk)
o check for X_NOT_STDC_ENV reversed in fig.h for inclusion of stdlib.h and
	defs of getenv() and atof()
	from Jonathan Kamens (jik@rtfm.mit.edu)
o SetDir() parameters added (but not used) to placate certain compilers
o point positioning resolution wasn't available with add-point-in-object
o angle geometry indicator appeared when moving/adding points but isn't used
o problem fixed with file popup and grab
	from David Brooke (BROOKE@leva.leeds.ac.uk)

	from Lars Berntzon (lasse@delila.cgl.se)
o new resource "textoutline" (class "TextOutline") and command-line argument
	"-textoutline" which will outline text in red to show the bounding box
	that the text will occupy when printed (useful for rotated text)
o print popup stays up until dismissed - can still pop up file/export menues, 
	draw etc. while print popup is up.  HOWEVER, while file or export 
	popups are up, the print panel is not active.
o can align all objects to canvas, not just to compound - use mouse button 2
	idea from Jon Forrest
o ellipses may now be rotated by an arbitrary angle and show their rotation

o more cleanup with respect to procedure/variable types/casts
	from Don Sharp (dws@mari.co.uk)
o fixed text bounds calculation to take into account any rotation when reading
	in figure from a file to decide whether to shift figure to keep on 
	canvas
	(fig2dev 2.1.5 is also fixed so figures with rotated text near edges
	should center properly now)
o fixed bug where segments disappeared while drawing interpolated spline in any
	LaTeX drawing mode
o rearranged a-z and A-Z keys in the CompKeyDB file because some HP computers
	were apparently doing random things with capitalization
	from Anthony Shipman (als@bohra.cpg.oz.au)
o fixed export of color figure to X11 bitmap format.  White -> white, all other
	colors -> black.

	which causes coredump on some HP machines.
	From Alfred van der Hoeven (alfred@arthur.et.tudelft.nl)
o fixed initialization bug in u_undo.c and object.c which caused HP 9000/700
	compilers to segfault
	From Alfred van der Hoeven (alfred@arthur.et.tudelft.nl)
o new environvemt variable "XFIGTMPDIR" used for xfig temporary files directory
o when reading a figure file, if any object coordinates are negative, the figure
	is shifted to keep it on the canvas so that the upper-left corner of the
	figure is placed on the current point positioning grid
	(in 2.1.4, the upper-left corner was placed at 10,10)
o changed "char" to "unsigned char" for initialization of bitmaps by compilers
	from Teus Hagen (teus@oce.nl)
o was passing floats to put_fmsg() instead of doubles.
o includes copy of X11/Xfuncs.h now to use correct routines for zeroing/copying

o added second line to Imakefile to put the xfig directory containing the 
	CompKeyDB (multi-key) database file in the standard X11 library
o fixed bug introduced in 2.1.1 which incorrectly placed radius marker of
	circles created by radius
o circle is now changed to ellipse type when scaled assymetrically
o fixed various typos in xfig.man
o changed references to mouse buttons left/middle/right to say buttons 1/2/3
	respectively
o radius of ellipses-specified-by-radius was one pixel too large
o changed interpretation of 1/0 bits in EPS preview bitmaps back to original
	0=white, 1=black according to EPSF guide version 2.0.
	Brought to my attention by Vivek Khera (khera@cs.duke.edu)
o moved #include Xaw... directives to figx.h to speed up compilation
o added conditional for Sun 3 and SunOs 4.0.3
	from Peter Scott (pjs@euclid.jpl.nasa.gov)

	from Jonathan Kamens (jik@MIT.Edu)
o epsf file wasn't closed after reading if there was no preview bitmap
	from Herve Poirier (rvp@dxcern.cern.ch)
o fixed bug where certain objects inside compound weren't being drawn when
	there was more than one compound object in the figure

	to $XFIGLIBDIR
	from Pete Kaiser (kaiser@heron.enet.dec.com)
o simple edit arrowhead feature in the popup edit for lines - can add/delete 
	arrow heads.  No adjustment of arrow size yet - uses current linewidth 
	from indicator panel
o Example figure files have all been converted to 2.1 file format
o if any object coordinates are negative, the whole figure is shifted to keep it
	on the canvas
o fixed major bug where the preview bitmap of EPS objects was in reverse video
	(1 is white not black, according to the PostScript Language Ref. Manual)
	*** SEE COMMENT IN PATCHLEVEL 5 ABOUT EPSI PREVIEW BITMAPS ***
o general cleanup of param types in Xt callback/action etc. procedures and other

	o new "Home" button changes directory to $HOME
	o ~ (username) operator allowed in the current directory ascii widget
	o new label widget shows the current figure filename
	o presssing "Load", "Save" or "Merge Read" will operate on the 
	  filename in the "Filename" window.  If that name is empty the
	  operation is done on the file specified in the "Current Filename" 
	  window.
	o additionally, the "Load" operation will copy the name (if any)
	  from the "Filename" window to the "Current Filename" window
	o pressing return in the "list of files" window in the popup File panel
	  will "Load" the file
o changes to the export popup:

	the screen)
o If you have Display Postscript in your server, compile xfig with -DDPS
	and you will see the full Postscript object instead of preview bitmap
	when you include EPS objects.
	!!! WARNING: this has only been tested on IBM's AIX 3.2 (X11R4) on
	an RS/6000 !!!
	from Dave Hale (dhale@green.mines.colorado.edu)

	can't export/print figure
o unused function clear_char_string() deleted from w_canvas.c
o current depth is now in an indicator window and may be set like line 
	thickness, color etc.
o added update tags to control which object components are modified/copied
	when using the update button.  Button appears in upper-right corner
	of indicator button (e.g linewidth) when in update mode.  Clicking 
	on the update tag enables/disables components (e.g. linewidth) from 
	being copied to/from objects when using update.
o fixed exporting of pstex_t and pstex (used to give Postscript for both)

	from David Elliot (dce@krusty.smsc.sony.com)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patchlevel 2 (Dec 1991)
Changes to Patchlevel 1:

o the font flag (LaTeX, PostScript) wasn't being changed correctly in the
	UPDATE text object operation when switching from LaTeX to PostScript 
	or vice versa.
o the textstep value may now be entered in floating point in the popup menu
o the eps-bitmap icon was renamed to eps-object because it can be any
	eps object that is imported.  If it has a preview bitmap
	that will be displayed.  Several filenames/program variables
	were also changed to reflect this.
o there is now a more general glue mechanism for compounding objects
o text pasting into canvas now possible with F18 function key or any translation
	desired by user.  F18 is hardwired default in program; F20 also 
	programmed in Fig.ad to paste text.
	Brian Boyter (pyrdc!bimbo!boyter@uunet.UU.NET)
o DEFAULT fill_style caused core dump 
	from Jeffry R. Abramson (jra@violin.att.com)

	from Per Fogelstr|m (pf@diab.se)
o cleaned up gcc compiler warnings about type mismatches etc.
o compound objects may be rotated by arbitrary angles if there are no boxes, 
	arc-boxes, ellipses or circles contained within.
o text rotation support is improved - markers are now shown rotated and
	the angle attribute is set by the relevant rotate operations.
o both ps and eps modes now supported in export menu.
o new directory browsing facilities integrated with File and Export popups.
	Allows selection of file by clicking on the filename.  Has mask to list
	only those files of interest.  See the man pages for further details.
o Default font for Postscript fonts may now be selected and objects that
	have default font may be edited
o FASTSERVER flag removed; now always uses smart redrawing when available
	Additionally, smart redrawing is available more often
o fixed bug in regular polygon where some vertices were off by one pixel
o added "Use orig. size" button for eps objects to set object to original 
	size in popup edit
	from Peter Scott (pjs@euclid.jpl.nasa.gov)
o international characters supported (umlauts, accents, cedilla etc) using
	compose (meta) key
	from Herve Soulard (soulard@corto.inria.fr)
o much improved color support
	from Henning Spruth (hns@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)
o additional pan and zoom mode with <Ctrl>Key and left/middle/right button
	from Henning Spruth (hns@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)
o removed reference to FONTLIBDIR in Imakefile (no longer required)
o added a smart-links feature for the MOVE and COPY commands.
	With smart links turned on, when a BOX-like object is moved
	so are the lines which join up to it (its links).
	Two modes are supported: one which moves just the endpoint,
	the other slides the endlink so that it's angle doesn't change.
	In the second mode horizontal/vertical lines remain that way.
o added the ability to save figure during quit if it is modified
o added support for scalable fonts under R5
o additional command line flags supported
	-latexfonts flag (resource .latexfonts) to start xfig with the LaTeX
	fonts as the default instead of PostScript fonts
	-specialtext flag (resource .specialtext) to start xfig with special
	text as the default
o bug fixed where number of objects count in file popup was sometimes clipped
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patchlevel 1 (Oct 1991)
Changes to Patchlevel 0:

o xfig now reads text size, height and length as floats and rounds to ints
	this is done because certain programs generate floats for these
o compound object was rounded to next larger grid even if objects inside were
	already on the grid
o Examples/logo.fig included Logo.eps instead of logo.eps
o cancellation of line drawing left single dot on screen
o filename in File popup menu didn't get set until first popup - file save 
	shortcut would save to unnamed.fig even if xfig was started with file name
o bug fixed in not being able to delete points from certain objects
o typo in FORMAT2.1 file (and all previous) stating that text angle is int when
	it is really float
o can now change corners of compound object with edit popup
	also shows number of objects inside compound
o file menu now shows number of objects in figure
o some bugs fixed in calculating bounding boxes after scaling ellipses and 
	compounds
o "#ifdefined SYSV" now reads "#if defined(SYSV) || defined(SVR4)" because X11R5
	doesn't define SYSV if SVR4 is defined
	David Elliott (dce@krusty.smsc.Sony.COM)
o object depths < 0 are converted to depth = 0
o typo in Adobe font name (was "-abode-new century schoolbook-medium-r-*--*")
	Jan Lindheim (lindheim@ccsf.caltech.edu)
o radius field for non-arcbox line objects now set to -1
	Jan Nusteling (j.nusteling@et.tudelft.nl)
o bug fixed in not trying to load an eps bitmap file called <empty>
	and not trying to reload an eps bitmap during a copy.
o bug fixed which caused crash after editing 0-width or 0-height ellipses
o bug fixed which caused incorrect mode after cancelling draw (int)spline
o bug fixed which caused incorrect minimum number of points for (int)spline
o bug fixed which caused erroneous large values to occur after box scale of
	0-width or 0-height objects.  You can no longer box scale such objects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 2.1
Patchlevel 0 (Sep 1991)
Changes to Version 2.0 Patchlevel 10:
Implemented by Paul King (king@cs.uq.oz.au) and
Brian Smith (envbvs@epb7.lbl.gov) with help from
Micah Beck (beck@cs.cornell.edu) and
Brian Boyter (pyrdc!bimbo!boyter@uunet.UU.NET) (EPS code).

USER INTERFACE
--------------

o The buttons are now grouped into three panels:

    COMMAND panel:
        Quit, Delete all, Undo, Redraw, Paste, File popup, Export popup and 
		Print popup buttons.  See man pages for details.
		(see "Drawing Modes", below for description of Cut)
    MODE panel:
	Allow the user to select the current drawing or editing mode.
    INDICATOR panel:
	By default shows indicator buttons relevant to the current mode.
	Each indicator button displays current setting of some quantity
	(e.g. line width, area-fill) and allows it to be changed:
        left button gives popup menu to select setting,
        middle/right buttons provide a shortcut to inc/decrement settings.

o Pan figure by using left/middle/right button in the rulers in addition to
	the previously supported arrow keys.  Also a pan to origin operation
	is available by clicking in the units window (or using HOME key).
o May now print figure that hasn't been saved (i.e. print what is on the 
	canvas, not the file)
o Zoom up or down with zoom button.
o Mouse function window shows function of active buttons
o New resources/command-line switches which affect the user interface:
	-showallbuttons		(show all indicator buttons all the time)
	-internalBW n		(use lines of width n between buttons/panels)

DRAWING MODES
-------------

o Regular polygon drawing button - select number of sized from bottom panel.
        Object created is normal xfig polygon.
o Inclusion of Encapsulated Postscript files (bitmap image in EPS file is
	displayed).
o Rubberbanding of ellipses/circles.
o Filled splines show areafill on screen now
        also dashed/dotted line type shows on screen
o Dot-gap and dash-length can be changed in the line-style indicator popup.

EDITING MODES
-------------

o Cut to buffer operation is now part of Copy object mode & Delete object mode.
o Update button to either update objects to current settings, or update
        indicator settings from an object.
o Rotation of certain objects by any angle (30, 45, 60, 90, 120 degrees can
	be selected using the mouse middle/right shortcut buttons).
o Alignment horizontally and/or vertically of objects to compound object edge(s)
o Objects can be scaled (not just compounds).
o Point move or object copy/move constrainable to horizontal or vertical
	movement (middle mouse button)
o Compound bounding corners shrink to fit enclosed objects and have markers
	that appear the same as other objects.
o Shift-click selection should work on all editing operations.
o Only the objects relevant to a particular editing operation will
	have their markers shown.

OVERALL OPERATION
-----------------

o Smarter redrawing (if compiled with -DFASTSERVER).
	Only the relevant objects are redrawn after an expose or after
	an edit operation (not all operations support this yet).
o Undo should work for all commands.
o Operations can now be cancelled (using the right button when appropriate).
o Point positioning to three resolutions:
	magnet (1/16inch), small grid or large grid
o TransFig 2.1 features: LaTex fonts, hidden text, scalable text, "special" text
        see TransFig man pages for description
        scalable text sizes with resizing of figure
o Attempts to save figure if signal detected (segmentation violation, etc)
o Resizing the xfig window should now be a bit smarter.
o The philosophy behind button usage has changed. This was necessary to
	provide a consistent (as possible) philosophy which supports the
	use of several buttons per mode.  Now the same button used to start
	an edit/draw operation is used to continue to the normal next step
	in the operation.  The right button can be used to cancel an operation.
	Watch the mouse function window until you get the hang of it.
