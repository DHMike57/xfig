 *	test4.c: Test whether point_spacing() returning 0 causes an exception,
 *		ticket #144.
 *	Author: Thomas Loimer, 2022-07-20
 *
 * Make appres.userscale (xfig -userscale 100) large enough such that
 * point_spacing() returns 0 and round_coords() calls round_square(), which
 * eventually tries  x % spacing  , causing SIGFPE.
