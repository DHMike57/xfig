<h2>How to Import Xfig Figures in Your LaTeX Files</h2></a>

Xfig can generate output to many different formats which TeX or LaTeX can
read.
The final document is produced by one of the following methods, depending on the
export language.

<dl>
<dt><img src="images/blueballdot.png" align=bottom alt="-">
<b>LaTeX picture, LaTeX with pict2e macros, TeX/LaTeX with tikz macros,
LaTeX with pstricks macros, LaTeX with epic/eepic/eepicemu macros:</b></dt>
<dd>The file generated from xfig is directly included, e.g.,
<tt>\input{fig1.tikz}</tt>, or the entire file contents is copied into your
TeX/LaTeX file. Therefore, the TeX/LaTeX document can contain all text and
graphics. Usually, it will be necessary to load a macro package to
enable TeX or LaTeX to process the file. Text that should be interpreted by
TeX/LaTeX must have the <i>TeX Flag</i> set to <i>ON</i>, see
<a href="attributes.html#text-flags">TEXT FLAGS</a>. Otherwise, characters
special to TeX will be quoted and, e.g.,
<tt>$x$</tt> will print as $x$, not <i>x</i>.

<dl>
    <dt><tt>latex</tt></dt>
    <dd>Include the generated file with, e.g., <tt>\input{fig1.latex}</tt>
	into your document, or simply embed it. No packages are required, but
	the capabilities of the <tt>latex</tt> output language are quite
	limited.</dd>
    <dt><tt>tikz</tt></dt>
    <dd><tt>\input{fig1.tikz}</tt> or embed the contents of the generated
	tikz file into the TeX-document. In the preamble of a LaTeX document,
	use<br>
	<tt>\usepackage{tikz, graphics} &nbsp;% graphics, if the figure contains
		embedded images<br>
	\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta, % if the figure contains arrow-tips<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	bending, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %
	arrow tips on arcs are "bent," i.e., deformed a bit<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	patterns &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %
	if the figure contains pattern fills<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt><br>
	The export to TeX/LaTeX with tikz macros supports all capabilites of
	xfig. LaTeX and Postscript fonts can be freely used and even mixed in
	the same figure, and the typesetting capabilities of TeX can be
	used.</dd>
    <dt><tt>pict2e</tt></dt>
	<dd>Embed or <tt>\input</tt> the generated file into your LaTeX
	document. In the preamble include<br>
	<tt>\usepackage{pict2e,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	color, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% if the figure contains color<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	graphics &nbsp;% if the figure contains embedded images<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	}</tt><br>
	Export to LaTeX with pict2e macros does not support pattern fills. All
	other features of a xfig drawing are reproduced. LaTeX and Postscript
	fonts can be used for text in the xfig drawing.</dd>
    <dt><tt>pstricks</tt></dt>
	<dd><tt>\usepackage{pstricks,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	pstricks-add, % for complex line styles and hollow PSTricks arrows (-R 1
option)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	graphicx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	% if the figure contains embedded images<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	}</tt><br>
	The pstricks output matches the quality of the Postscript driver. Text
	is rendered black, but LaTeX font color-changing code can be embedded in
	the text.</dd>

</dl></dd>

<dt><img src="images/blueballdot.png" align=bottom alt="-">
<b>EPS, PDF, EPS and PDF:</b></dt>
<dd>Export the figure from xfig to eps or pdf (or both) and import the
file with <tt>\includegraphics</tt> into your document.
Write<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \usepackage{graphics}</tt><br>
into the preamble and include the drawing with, e.g.,
<tt>\includegraphics{fig1.eps}</tt> or <tt>\includegraphics{fig1}</tt>.
This method supports all capabilities of xfig, but only Postscript fonts are
used to render text.
To make use of the fonts and of the typesetting possibilities of LaTeX, one
could use the <tt>psfrag</tt> package to replace text strings in an eps file
with code rendered by LaTeX.</dd><br>

<dt><img src="images/blueballdot.png" align=bottom alt="-">
<b>Combined PS/LaTeX, Combined PDF/LaTeX, Combinded PS/PDF/LaTeX:</b></dt>
<dd>Export the figure to two files or even three files, partially to eps or pdf
or to both, and partially to a LaTeX file, and include the LaTeX file in your
document.
The LaTeX file contains the text and includes either the eps or pdf file which
contains the graphics.
Text marked with the <i>TeX Flag</i> set to <i>ON</i> is rendered by
LaTeX and superimposed over the included graphics.
In the preamble, put<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
\usepackage{graphics,color} % color, if the text is colored</tt><br>
Write <tt>\input{fig1.pstex_t}</tt> for latex + eps,
<tt>\input{fig1.pdf_t}</tt> for latex + pdf, or <tt>\input{fig1.pspdftex}</tt>
for latex + eps or pdf at the location where the drawing should appear.
The export to Combined PS/PDF/LaTeX, latex + eps or pdf, can be processed by any
LaTeX engine.</dd>
</dl>

A variant of the second method above is to
<dl>
<dt><img src="images/blueballdot.png" align=bottom alt="-">
<b>create a stand-alone tex file and import the generated EPS or PDF:</b></dt>
<dd>The tex-file cannot be exported directly from xfig, but you must invoke
<tt>fig2dev</tt> from the command line with the <tt>-P</tt> option of the tikz
or pict2e driver. Save your drawing, and invoke <tt>fig2dev</tt> on the saved
fig-file, e.g., for the <tt>tikz</tt> driver,<br><tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ fig2dev -L tikz fig1.fig fig1.tex<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ pdflatex fig1.tex</tt><br>
Include the final <tt>fig1.pdf</tt> with <tt>\includegraphics{fig1}</tt> into
your LaTeX document.
This tex-file is processed by LaTeX to create a pdf or eps graphics that can be
included into your LaTeX document. The advantage of this method above the direct
export to pdf or eps is that text can be rendered with LaTeX- and Postscript
fonts, and TeX/LaTeX expressions are interpreted in text on which the <i>TeX
flag</i> is set to <i>On</i>.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
To set the <a href="attributes.html#text-flags">TEXT FLAG</a> <i>TeX Flag</i> to
<i>ON</i> and use LaTeX-fonts for all text, invoke xfig with the
commandline<br><tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ xfig -specialtext -latexfonts -startlatexFont default</tt><br>
To make the above permanently and start all drawings with LaTeX fonts and the
<i>TeX flag</i> set to <i>ON</i>, put the following in your X-resources file.
This is probably the file <tt>.Xresources</tt> in your home directory.<tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig.latexfonts: true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig.specialtext: true</tt>
</p>

<a name="picsize">
<h3>Changing the Size of Pictures</h3></a>

If possible, try to not scale drawings at all. Different line thicknesses
should be a avoided, similarly to avoiding differently sized letters in
text. The rulers at the top and at the side, and the magnification setting
in the lower left corner of the xfig window may aid at producing the
graphics at the right size.

<p>
If scaling cannot be avoided, the commands <tt>\scalebox</tt> and
<tt>\resizebox</tt> from the graphics package can be used,
<pre>
\scalebox{1.5}{\input{fig1.pstex_t}}	% \scalebox{factor}{object}
\resizebox{10cm}{!}{\input{fig1.latex}}	% \resizebox{width}{height}{object}
</pre>
An exclamation mark in place of one of the dimensions retains the aspect
ratio of the object.

<p>
To set the width of tikz-drawings produced by xfig, you can use
<pre>
\newlength\XFigwidth\XFigwidth84mm
\newlength\XFigheight\XFigheight56mm
</pre>
before input'ing your figure.
This will scale the coordinates of the drawing, but not line widths or
text. If only one of the two dimensions is given, the
figure retains its aspect ratio. To render subsequent figures in their
original size, both dimensions must be undefined or set to zero,
<pre>\XFigwidth0pt \XFigheight0pt</pre>

<h2>Xfig and Metapost</h2></a>
written by Josselin Mouette (jmouette@ens-lyon.fr)

<ol>
<li>METAPOST
   <br>
   There is nothing special to do in xfig to use MetaPost. All the
   text you type will be treated as plain TeX code - note, this will
   be not compiled within your document, so you don't have acess to
   packages like AMS-TeX, neither have you to your macros.
   In xfig, export your file with the MetaPost filter, it creates
   <tt>foo.mp</tt>.  Then, type mpost foo.mp, it will generate <tt>foo.0</tt>
   (or <tt>foo.1</tt>, sometimes).
   In your document, put this in the preamble:
    <pre>
    \input supp-pdf.tex
    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
    </pre>
   And to include your figure :
    <pre>
    \convertMPtoPDF{foo.0}{1}{1}
    </pre>
   That's it. Quite simple, and you can put a bit TeX inside.
   <br>
   Pros: Can be easily included in a dual-output (pdf/dvi) file: for
	 including it as PS, just put a <tt>\includegraphics{foo.0}</tt> in the
	 document.
   <br>
   Cons: Not adapted to big formulas, as AMS-LaTeX is not
	 accessible. Long phrases may look bad as well, if your
	 document is not in English (babel cannot be used).

<p>
<li>MULTI-METAPOST
   <br>
   This method is designed to be used in PDF presentations. Using the
   <tt>\pause</tt> command, it will display step by step the layers of your
   figure as you click on the button, which can look very nice (and
   can even be useful sometimes).  All that have been told about
   MetaPost inclusions is true, but there are a few extra things to
   know:
   <p>
   <ol type="A">
   <li>
   When creating your figure, be careful with the depth of your
   objects. When exporting your figure in the MultiMetaPost format,
   transfig will treat the consecutive depth levels where is an object
   as a single layer, for example:
   <pre>
   Circle at depth 51 \__first displayed layer
   Text at depth 50   /
   *** Nothing at depth 49
   Square at depth 48 \
   Text at depth 48    &gt; Second displayed layer
   Curve at depth 47  /
   ... and so on.
   </pre></p>

   <li>
   After exporting, mpost <tt>foo.mmp</tt> will create a set of files named
   <tt>foo.0, foo.1...</tt>
   To include them in the document, you will need the mpmulti.sty
   provided with the latest version of PPower4 (still in Beta stage at
   the time of writing).
   The preamble of your document should look like this:
    <pre>
    \input supp-pdf.tex
    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
    \usepackage{pause,mpmulti}
    </pre>
   And to include your animation, just put:
    <pre>
    \multiinclude{foo}
    </pre>
   You can adjust it to a defined size by using:
    <pre>
    \multiinclude[graphics={width=5cm}]{foo}
    </pre>
   Compile your document, then ppower4 it. Nifty, isn't it?
   <br>
   Pros: The only way to insert automatically animations. Benefit of
	 the existing xfig's depth system.
   <br>
   Cons: Are there any?
