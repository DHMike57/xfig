The following are applications which can produce Fig files as their output:

************************************************************************
figbuild - figbuild reads xfig files (Version 3.x, tested with 3.1, 3.2) plus
	its own config file for heights, and generates a Radiance input
	file. Written by Peter Apian-Bennewitz at Fraunhofer ISE, Germany
	see:
	http://www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/pabs-toolbox/figbuild/figbuild.html

************************************************************************
xfigbar and xfigpie - Two C programs to produce bar and pie charts as Fig
	files.  Written by John Conover <john@johncon.johncon.com>,
	these programs are available by sending email thus:

	mail info-request@johncon.com
	Subject: archive

	get xfigutilities.shar

************************************************************************
mifXfig - MIF to XFig and XFig to MIF Converter 
	see http://www.ida.liu.se/~vaden/teaching/m2f/ for details, but it
	basically converts to and from MIF and Fig files
	From Vadim Engelson (vaden@ida.liu.se)

************************************************************************
pstoedit - converts Postscript(TM) files to other vector graphic formats
	that can be edited. Besides Fig output, tgif, Framemaker(TM) (MIF-
	format) and flattened PostScript are supported along with several
	others.
	You need a C++ compiler to install and GhostScript to run pstoedit.
	pstoedit should run on all Un*x like systems and has also been ported
	to OS/2 and DOS.

	ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/pstoedit/pstoedit.html

************************************************************************
hp2xx - converts HPGL to EPS, LaTex, Fig or simplified HPGL converter
	Now maintained by Martin Kroeker (mk@daveg.com)
	available from ftp.gnu.org and the usual mirror sites

************************************************************************
chemtool - Chemical structure editor for X11 available from
	http://www.uni-ulm.de/~s_tvolk/chemtool that writes Fig
	output (and relies on transfig for anything more fancy than xbm)

************************************************************************
xgraph - plotting package for X - version on iworks.ecn.uiowa.edu in
	comp.hp has version that can output Fig files

************************************************************************
gnuplot - Plotting package; can output in Fig format.
	For the location of gnuplot, here is the (paraphrased) excerpt from
	the FAQ.  Note, that although there are versions of gnuplot for
	several different platforms, xfig only runs under X11.

	The official distribution site for the gnuplot source is dartmouth.edu,
	in /pub/gnuplot.  Official mirrors of that distribution are (for
	Australia) monu1.cc.monash.edu.au and (for Europe) irisa.irisa.fr.
	You can also get it from your friendly neighbourhood comp.sources.misc
	archive.

	MS-DOS and MS-Windows binaries are available from oak.oakland.edu
	(North America) as pub/msdos/plot/gpt34*.zip, garbo.uwasa.fi (Europe)
	as /pc/plot/gpt34*.zip and archie.au (Australia) as
	micros/pc/oak/plot/gpt34*.zip.  The files are: gpt34doc.zip,
	gpt34exe.zip, gpt34src.zip and gpt34win.zip.

	OS/2 2.x binaries are at ftp-os2.nmsu.edu in /os2/2.x/unix/gnu/gplt34.zip.

	Amiga sources and binaries are available from wuarchive.wustl.edu
	as /pub/amiga/aminet/util/gnu/gnuplot-3.4*; there are numerous mirrors
	of this distribution.

	The NeXTSTEP front end can be found at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and
	cs.orst.edu.

	A version for OS-9/68K can be found at cabrales.cs.wisc.edu in
	/pub/OSK/GRAPHICS; it includes both an X and non - X versions.

	A version of gnuplot for the Macintosh is included in the gpcontrb
	file, or can be found at wuarchive.wustl.edu in
	edu/math/mac/graphingAids, as MacGnuPlot3.2.sea.hqx and
	MacGnuPlotPackage3.2.sea.hqx.

************************************************************************
pic2fig - converts PIC (used with troff/ditroff/etc) to Fig.
	May be found at ftp.cs.orst.edu in /localsrc/graphics and
	at ftp.x.org in /contrib/utilities.

************************************************************************
GNU plotutils - includes an application for XY plotting (graph),
	a plot filter (plot), a Tektronix translator (tek2plot),
	a program for displaying font character maps (plotfont),
	and a library for drawing 2-D vector graphics (libplot), 
	all of which produce output in xfig format.

************************************************************************
cdraw2fig - converts cdraw to Fig

	Here is the cdraw README file:

	cdraw2fig translates pictures from "Cheap Draw" format to Fig format.
	The TransFig package can then be used for translation to the desired
	output format.  Currently supported formats include PIC, (E)EPIC, LaTeX,
	PostScript, and several others.

	cdraw2fig is implemented in the awk programming language.  Most Cheap
	Draw operations are handled in some way, although some of the transla-
	tions are somewhat arbitrary.  Note that some output formats are con-
	siderably less expressive than Cheap Draw (and Fig).  PIC, for example,
	supports neither shading or rotated text.  In addition, precise text
	spacing is problematic across the different output formats.

	The following files are included in this distribution:

	       README          - this file
	       cdraw2fig.uu    - ksh script with self-contained awk program
				 (uuencoded)
	       example         - sample "Cheap Draw" file (from the original
				 Cheap Draw distribution)

	To translate a Cheap Draw file to PIC (for example):

	       $ cdraw2fig example > example.fig
	       $ fig2dev -Lpic example.fig > example.pic

	Cheap Draw 2.0 was written by Bob Pratt and is available from the UNIXPC
	archives at osu-cis.  

************************************************************************
Msphinx - a friendly package to handle satellite images.

      Main features:
      	Msphinx includes two types of analysis and processing functions:
	   - Functions to process the basic data geometry and
			projection planes.
	   - Functions to manipulate and modify the graphic display and print.

       Communication capabilities:
	   - Data writes from external user programs
		(C or Fortran) into the memory planes.
	   - User-to-user data exchange (text or images).
	   - User image data base visualisation.
	   - Direct links to other packages:
		- Mgraph (2d and contouring plotting)
		- HDFLook (HDF read write files)
>>>		- Xfig (Facility for Interactive Generation of figures)
		- mpeg_encode (mpeg format nimations)

	Find it at:
