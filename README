XFIG - Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11
===============================================================


Xfig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
interactively in an X window.  The resulting pictures can be saved, printed
on postscript printers or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g. to
allow inclusion in LaTeX documents).

This file contains some notes about installing xfig, the directory
'Examples' contains some example figures and the 'Doc' directory contains
some further documentation including the manual in troff -man format
and PostScript.

Please report any bugs, fixes, contributions, etc. to:

NOTE FOR version 3.1.0

  An error in version 3.0.0 incorrectly positioned objects on the canvas
  when reading older fig files.  New objects entered with 3.0 are
  correctly positioned.  A warning will popup when you load a version 3.0
  file with version 3.1 that says you might need to offset your figure by
  14 fig units in X and Y when you load it.  This is done by setting the
  X and Y offset in the popup File panel.
  I apologize for the inconvenience.

  This is also why the file version number has changed.

INSTALLATION NOTES:
===================

1. Edit the Imakefile if you need to customize it (see following notes)
2. Type "xmkmf" to create the Makefile from the Imakefile
   2a. For a 3D look, see NOTE below
3. Type "make install" (if you don't do this step, be sure to install resources)
4. Type "make install.man"
5. For X11R5 color implementations, specify "*customization: -color" in your 
	.Xdefaults or .Xresources file.
	NOTE: this only works under X11R5.

If you have the XPM3 package (X11 color pixmaps) you can export your figures
   in that format.  Also, you can import xpm files as picture objects.
   Uncomment the XPMDEFINES and related variables in the Imakefile in that case.
   You need version 3.4c or newer.  This is available from ftp.x.org in
   /contrib/libraries.
If you have ghostscript, enable the -DGSBIT flag in the Imakefile and xfig will
   attempt to use it to interpret any encapsulated Postscript (EPS) files you
   import.  Ghostscript must be compiled with with the "gif8" and "pbmraw"
   drivers.  The pbm driver is used when you run xfig on a monochrome display
   and the gif8 driver is used on a color display.
If your system doesn't have strstr(), add the flag -DNOSTRSTR in the Imakefile
   in the DEFINES line.
If you are running on an IBM RS/6000 with AIX 3.2 or a Sun with Solaris 2.3,
   uncomment the lines that define DPSLIB and DPSDEF in the Imakefile and you
   will see the full PostScript object when using EPS objects.
If you have an input tablet and your X server supports the XInputExtension
   uncomment the lines that define TABLIB and USETAB in the Imakefile.
   Start xfig with -tablet or define the resource Fig.Tablet to use it.
 
NOTE: For a 3D look, I recommend using Kaleb Keithley's 3D Athena Widget set,
a direct replacement for the Xaw library.  After you compile and install that
package, and after step 1 above, just uncomment the definition of XAWLIB in
the Imakefile and it will use the 3D widget set.
This set is available from ftp.x.org.

The maximum width of the top ruler is set to 1020 pixels and the height of the
side ruler to 860 pixels.  If your server can handle pixmaps larger than this
and you need longer/taller rulers, you may set the maximum allowed in your
Imakefile with -DMAX_TOPRULER_WD=1160 (or whatever value you wish) and 
-DMAX_SIDERULER_HT=1024 (or whatever value you wish).

The SMOOTHMOTION option toggles between two methods for tracking the
cursor.  The first way (SMOOTHMOTION) just uses the (x,y) information given
in the X pointer motion event.  If your display server doesn't implement
motion compression this is very slow for large movements of the mouse
pointer because X sends back lots of small movement events, each of which
causes the rubberband box to be erased and redrawn.  The alternative
way (not SMOOTHMOTION) queries the position of the X cursor whenever
a motion event is received and if you make a large movement and then
stop actually turns out to involve less work even though the XQueryPointer
call is quite slow.

The SMOOTHMOTION flag MIGHT be necessary for older versions of OpenWindows on
certain machines if the performance is slow when moving or drawing objects.

----------------------
Printing your figures:
----------------------

The program to translate your figure into one of many printer languages
(Postscript, LaTex, etc) is called fig2dev and is part of the TransFig
package by Micah Beck.
It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/transfig.tar.Z or
ftp.cs.cornell.edu in the directory /pub/fig.
See the man pages for more information.

If you have a SYSV system but use BSD-style printing (lpr instead of lp) you
must define -DBSDLPR in the Imakefile/Makefile.

-----------------
Solaris users
-----------------

Add "-lc" to the LOCAL_LIBRARIES variable in the Imakefile to link with 
/usr/lib/libc for the directory operations.

Some people have had trouble with the Sun cc 3.0.1 compiler and optimization.
You may need to shut off optimization.
A common symptom is that xfig just core dumps when starting.

-----------------
OpenWindows users
-----------------

Xfig now automatically looks for the OpenWindows style of font names
(e.g. times-roman-13) and uses those when available so the -DOPENWIN flag
is no longer necessary 

There is no need to compile with the -DOPENWIN_BUG flag anymore for 
OpenWindows 2.0 (or any version of OpenWindows for that matter).

----------------------------------------------
Possible problems encountered installing xfig:
----------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
	When using LaTeX fonts in Xfig I always end up with postscript
	fonts instead rather than, say, Computer Modern. 

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	To put fonts under the control of LaTeX when generating PS, you must
	tag the text object as "special" and then use the pstex output mode.
	This mode forces special text objects to be passed through to LaTeX,
	allowing the use of Math mode and CM fonts among other things.

PROBLEM:
	xfig hangs when pressing the Text or Update button.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	Increase the height of the indicator panel by changing init_ind_panel()
	where it says:

        i = DEF_IND_SW_HT+4*INTERNAL_BW+14;  /* allow for thickness of scrollbar */

	Try increasing the 14 to 16 or 20 and see if that fixes it.  Please
	send me email if you have to do this and tell me the value you used.
________________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEM:
	On a DEC Alpha the compiler may complain about something like: ".mask
	must have pcreg from .frame set if any bits are set in .mask or .fmask"
	in the file u_bound.c.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	Set the optimization level to -O1 at least for that file.
________________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEM:
	On Sun machines the linker may give erroneous error messages about 
	the following symbols being undefined:

	ld: Undefined symbol
	   _get_applicationShellWidgetClass
	   _get_wmShellWidgetClass

	This may be ignored as it is a problem with the Sun shared libraries
	and the way X11 builds the shared Xmu library.  It doesn't affect the
	operation of xfig.
________________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEM:
	The window oscillates and fights with the window manager when
	I click on a mode button or try to resize the xfig window.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
 	Perhaps the following resource has been set
 		*allowShellResize: true
	because another program requires it to be true.
	Change the resource to be specific to the programs which need it,
	or set the following resource:
 		Fig*allowShellResize: false
	Note: this is in the Fig.ad file that comes with xfig, which is 
	      installed when you do a "make install".
________________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEM:
	Openwindows sometimes loses track of xfig's icon.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	Cause unknown, here is a temporary kludge. Place the line:
		Fig*iconPixmap:               ..../your_lib_area/fig.icon.X
	in your .Xdefaults file and copy fig.icon.X into your lib area.
________________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEM:
	When compiling on an HP 750 running HP-UX 8.05, the compiler dies with
	a bus error in the file u_undo.c.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	There is a bug in the HP compiler.  Workaround the problem by adding
	an extra statement between two statements in u_undo.c:

	Original:

	undo_glue()
	{
	    list_delete_compound(&objects.compounds, saved_objects.compounds);
	    tail(&objects, &object_tails);

	New:

	undo_glue()
	{
	    list_delete_compound(&objects.compounds, saved_objects.compounds);
>>>	    /* HP-UX 8.05 compiler bug fix -- don't ask */
>>>	    last_action = last_action;
	    tail(&objects, &object_tails);
________________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEMS:
	On HP machines, the capitalization of some letters in the text window 
	in the edit popup for text objects are wrong.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	Make sure that the CompKeyDB file has the lowercase letter definitions
	BEFORE the uppercase definitions.  This should be the case for the 
	CompKeyDB file shipped with xfig 2.1.5 and later.
________________________________________________________________________________
PROBLEMS:
	On HP computers using cc compiler version A.09.61 there is a problem with
	level 3 optimization. 

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	Use level 2 instead.
