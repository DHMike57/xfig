------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:

Openwindows has scalable fonts so xfig must be compiled with the -DOPENWIN
flag in order to handle this.

There is also a bug in OpenWindows 2.0 which relates to pixmaps in widgets.
You must compile xfig with the -DOPENWIN_BUG option for this problem.

Possible problems encountered installing xfig:
=============================================

PROBLEM:
	The window oscillates and fights with the window manager when
	I click on a mode button or try to resize the xfig window.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
 	Perhaps the following resource has been set
 		*allowShellResize: true
	because another program requires it to be true.
	Change the resource to be specific to the programs which need it.

PROBLEM:
	I tried to compile xfig on an SGI SystemV and got a error message.
	> cc -O -prototypes -cckr -float -I/usr/include -DSYSV
		-DMALLOC_0_RETURNS_NULL -DFUNCPROTO -DNARROWPROTO
		-DFASTSERVER  -c u_redraw.c
	>(ccom): u_redraw.c, line 106: ccom: Internal: out of tree space;
		increase default option: -Wf,-XNh1000
	>                        spline_depths(objects->splines)))))))))));

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	The line in question involves quite a few levels of nesting and
	could possibly be simplified.  Use the options -Wf,-XNh6000 as the
	compiler message suggests and you shouldn't have any trouble.
