XFIG - Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11
===============================================================


Xfig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
interactively in an X window.  The resulting pictures can be saved, printed
on postscript printers or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g. to
allow inclusion in LaTeX documents).

This file contains some notes about installing xfig, the directory
'Examples' contains some example figures and the 'Doc' directory contains
some further documentation including the manual in troff -man format.

Please report any bugs, fixes, contributions, etc. to:

===================
INSTALLATION NOTES:
===================

1. Edit the Imakefile if you need to customize it (see following notes)
2. Type "make Makefile" or "xmkmf" if you have xmkmf
>> Ignore the warning about redefining InstallManPage <<

3. Type "make install"
4. Type "make install.man"
5. Add the resources from Fig.ad to /usr/lib/.../app-defaults/Fig that you
	wish to use

-----------------
OpenWindows users
-----------------

Openwindows has scalable fonts so xfig must be compiled with the -DOPENWIN
flag in order to handle this.

There is also a bug in OpenWindows 2.0 which relates to pixmaps in widgets.
You must compile xfig with the -DOPENWIN_BUG option for this problem.

----------------------
Printing your figures:
----------------------

The program to translate your figure into one of many printer languages
(Postscript, LaTex, etc) is called fig2dev and is part of the TransFig
package by Micah Beck.
It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/transfig.tar.Z or
ftp.cs.cornell.edu in the directory /pub/fig.
See the man pages for more information.

----------------------------------------------
Possible problems encountered installing xfig:
----------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
	The window oscillates and fights with the window manager when
	I click on a mode button or try to resize the xfig window.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
 	Perhaps the following resource has been set
 		*allowShellResize: true
	because another program requires it to be true.
	Change the resource to be specific to the programs which need it.

PROBLEM:
	Openwindows sometimes loses track of xfig's icon.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	Cause unknown, here is a temporary kludge. Place the line:
		Fig*iconPixmap:               ..../your_lib_area/fig.icon.X
	in your .Xdefaults file and copy fig.icon.X into your lib area.

PROBLEM:
	I can't seem to get a single xfig binary to work under both
	openwindows and standard X.

POSSIBLE CAUSE AND SOLUTION:
	You can compile xfig so that it knows about openwindows fonts
	but then it won't work under standard X.  If you want a single
	binary, compile with -DOPENWIN_BUG but not -DOPENWIN.  This
	will work on both systems but you won't be able to access the
	openwindows fonts.
