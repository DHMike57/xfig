	  correct thing, though.
<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	Depth manager didn't update correctly if depth between two other

<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	Opening a compound object, changing an object inside, closing the

<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	Character array illegally freed in screen capture procedure
<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	There is a less restrictive copyright on the html pages.  Instead of:
	    "However, you may not modify any part of this documentation
	    without explicit permission of T.Sato or Brian V. Smith."
	  there is now:

	  segfault

	  picture object), argument list[0] wasn't name of image editor
<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">

	  correctly in figure preview
<p>

<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	If user is previewing a figure (in the popup file panel) and the canvas

<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	When browsing pictures in the import picture interface, if you single-

<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	Stops parsing library directories when limit is reached
<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	Doc/FORMAT3.2 file (and all previous) incorrectly described the bounding
	  box for compound objects as having upper-right and lower-left values,
	  when in fact they have upper-*left* and lower-*right* bound values
<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	On a PseudoColor server, with xfig in -mono mode, it attempted to store
	  a color illegally
<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	Editing of comments for picture objects wasn't retained
<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	Library directory now may include files with more than just .fig in name

	  whatever matches *.fig* isn't a directory.
<p>
<img src="images/blueballdot.gif" alt="-">
	Missing quote for MKDIRHIER variable in Imakefile:
	  XCOMM MKDIRHIER = "/bin/sh /usr/bin/X11/mkdirhier"
