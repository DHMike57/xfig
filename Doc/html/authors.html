<b>Xfig</b> was originally written by Supoj Sutanthavibul at the
University of Texas at Austin in 1985 for SunView.
Later, Ken Yap, at Rochester, did the first port of <b>xfig</b> to X11.
At some point in 1989, Brian V. Smith picked it up and added features such as multiple
fonts, line thickness, area fill etc.  Around 1991, Paul King
at the University of Queensland, Austrailia added many features and
overhauled the look
and feel of <b>xfig</b> for version 2.0, to produce essentially what you see today.
In 1992, Brian Boyter added the ability to import EPS files, and later it
was expanded to import several other bitmap formats as well.
T. Sato added the Japanese text support for <b>xfig</b> in 1997.

<a href="http://www-epb.lbl.gov/BVSmith">Brian V. Smith</a> 
is the main contact for <b>xfig</b> and its incorporation of new
features written either by himself or others.
<p>
There have been dozens of people who have contributed to the success 
(and code)of <b>xfig</b>,
and they are too numerous to mention here.  The man pages list some of those
people.  See below for the major copyrights.

<I>Because Unisys has stated that they will not charge royalties for the
use of the LZW compression algorithm in FREE programs, <b>xfig</b> will continue
to support importing and exporting of GIF images. However, be aware that
if you sell <b>xfig</b>, for example as part of a CD-ROM package with freeware,
you may be liable for paying royalties to Unisys. It is recommended that
you comment out the "</i><tt>#define USEGIF</tt><i>" line in the 
Imakefile before compiling and selling <b>xfig</b>.</I>
