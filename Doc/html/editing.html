<dd>Glue selected objects and make them a COMPOUND object.
This is useful to <a href="#move">move</a> 
or <a href="#copy">copy</a> some objects together at the same time.
It is also possible to scale part of a figure
by <a href="#scale">scaling</a> a COMPOUND object
after making part of the figure COMPOUND.
<p>
Clicking on an object with mouse button 1 (`tag object')
will tag the object.
Clicking one corner of a rectangular region
with mouse button 2 (`tag region')
and then clicking mouse button 2 (`final corner') again
at the opposite corner of the rectangular region
will tag all objects inside the region.
After tagging all objects to be glued into a COMPOUND object,
clicking mouse button 3 (`compound tagged') will
glue those objects and make them a COMPOUND object.
<p>
If an already tagged object is selected by mouse button 1
or mouse button 2, that object will be untagged.
If you want to remove all tags,
change the mode temporarily to any other mode (e.g. "move object") except BREAK COMPOUND.
<p>
The COMPOUND object may be separated into component objects by
<a href="#break-compound">BREAK COMPOUND</a>.

<hr>

  <a name="break-compound">(BREAK COMPOUND)</a>
<dd>Break a COMPOUND object into separate component objects.
<p>
Clicking a COMPOUND object with mouse button 1 (`break compound')
will break the COMPOUND into separate component objects.
Clicking with mouse button 2 (`break and tag')
will also achieve the same effect,
but it will tag those component objects for re-gluing with
<a href="#glue-compound">GLUE COMPOUND</a> again.
<p>
If you want to edit component objects without breaking the COMPOUND object,
you may open the COMPOUND object temporarily
using <a href="#open-compound">OPEN COMPOUND</a>.

<hr>

<dt><img src="images/open-compound-button.gif" alt="">
  <a name="open-compound">(OPEN COMPOUND)</a>
<dd>Open a compound object temporarily for editing the component objects.
<p>
Clicking a COMPOUND object with mouse button 1 (`open compound')
will open the COMPOUND object,
and then the component objects may be edited.
All other objects which were not in the COMPOUND object
will become invisible temporarily,
but they will reappear after all COMPOUND objects are closed.
<p>
A popup panel with two buttons to close the COMPOUND objects
(<i>Close This Compound</i> and <i>Close All Compounds</i>)
will appear when a COMPOUND object is opened,
and the open COMPOUND may be closed again using those buttons.
Clicking <i>Close This Compound</i> will close the COMPOUND object last opened,
and clicking <i>Close All Compounds</i> will close all nested, opened COMPOUND objects.
<p>
If you want to break a COMPOUND object into component objects,
use <a href="#break-compound">BREAK COMPOUND</a>.
<p>
If the File/Save is attempted while a compound is open, <b>xfig</b>
will ask if you want to save only the open COMPOUND object (Save Part)
or the whole figure (Save All).
<p>
<img src="images/pict-info.gif" alt="">
<i>Note</i>:
If you open a COMPOUND object,
<a href="#delete">delete</a> an object in that COMPOUND object,
close the COMPOUND object and 
<a href="main_menus.html#undo">Undo</a> the delete operation,
the object you deleted will reappear but it will outside of the COMPOUND object.
Conversely, if you delete an object from the canvas,
open a compound then undo the delete of the original object,
it will now be part of the open compound.
In this way you may add or remove selected objects from a COMPOUND.

<h2><img src="images/pict-info.gif" alt="">
  <a name="select-object">Selecting Objects</a></h2>

Objects may be selected by clicking the <i>corner markers</i>
(<i>handles</i>) of the object.
The corner markers are small square marks
which are displayed at the corner point of objects
which may be selected for any particular mode.
<p>
Most objects may also be selected by clicking on the line 
connecting corner markers,
but it may have a different meaning in some editing modes.
For example in the <a href="#scale">SCALE OBJECT</a> mode,
clicking on a corner marker will scale the object proportionally
to its horizontal/vertical ratio,
but clicking on a line connecting corner markers (edge of the rectangle)
will scale the object only in that direction (i.e. horizontally or vertically).
<p>
If <a href="attributes.html#point-position">POINT POSITION</a> 
is set to other than <i>Any</i>,
objects which are not on the virtual grid may not be be selected.
<p>
When object corners or edges are coincident, clicking on the object
may not select the desired object but the other object instead.
In this case, the desired object may be selected with following operations:
<ol>
<li>Press (and hold) the SHIFT key and click on the object to be selected.
<li>If the corner marker of the other object is highlighted,
keep the SHIFT key down and click the object again.
<li>When corner marker of the desired object is highlighted,
release the SHIFT key and click the object again.
</ol>
Note that you shouldn't move the mouse during this operation.
